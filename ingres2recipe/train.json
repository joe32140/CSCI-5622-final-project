        "Heat oven to 500F with rack in middle. Make a deep cut into the top side of tenderloin, about 4 inches from tail end, to facilitate folding the tail end under the roast to give the meat a more uniform thickness. Tie roast at 1-inch intervals with kitchen string. Cook pancetta in a large rimmed baking sheet in oven, stirring once, until fat is rendered and pancetta is crisp, 4 to 8 minutes. Transfer pancetta with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Add tomatoes and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper to fat in rimmed baking sheet and stir, then roast in oven 15 minutes. Stir in garlic and olives and roast until tomatoes are falling apart and browned in patches, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove sheet from oven, then add pancetta and 1/2 cup water, scraping up brown bits. Lower oven temperature to 350F. Toss together bread crumbs, 2 tablespoons oil, and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper in a bowl. Stir together mustard and rosemary in a small bowl. Pat tenderloin dry and sprinkle all over with 1 1/4 teaspoons each salt and pepper, rubbing into meat. Set roasting pan over 2 burners, then add remaining 3 tablespoons oil and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Brown tenderloin on all sides, about 10 minutes. Spread top and upper part of sides with mustard mixture, then sprinkle evenly with bread crumbs. Pat lightly to adhere. Roast tenderloin until thermometer inserted diagonally 2 inches into center of thickest part of meat registers 120F, 30 to 40 minutes. Transfer beef to a cutting board and let stand 15 minutes (internal temperature will rise to about 130F for medium-rare). Set roasting pan over 2 burners and add remaining 1 cup water. Bring to a boil, scraping up brown bits, then stir in tomato mixture and parsley. Cut tenderloin into 1/2-inch-thick slices, discarding string, and serve with tomato mixture.",

        "Line a 9x13 pan with parchment paper and coat the paper very generously with cornstarch. Have a candy thermometer at hand. Put 1/3 cup of the water, 1 1/4 cups of the sugar and the corn syrup in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Once the sugar is dissolved, continue to cook the syrup without stirring until it reaches 265 degrees F on the candy thermometer, about 10 minutes. While the syrup is cooking, work on the gelatin and egg whites. In a microwave-safe bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over the remaining cold water (a scant 7 tablespoons) and let it sit for about 3 minutes, until it is spongy, then heat the gelatin in a microwave oven for 20 to 30 seconds to liquify it. Working in the clean, dry bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or in another large bowl with a hand mixer, beat the egg whites and the additional 1 tablespoon sugar on medium-high speed until firm but still glossy dont overbeat them and allow them to go dull. As soon as the syrup reaches 265 degrees F, remove the pan from the heat and, with the mixer on medium speed, add the syrup to your egg mixture, pouring it between the spinning whisk and the sides of the bowl. Add the gelatin and continue to beat for another 3 minutes, so that the syrup and the gelatin are fully incorporated. Beat in the rum cream and food coloring until well incorporated. Using a large rubber spatula, scrape the meringue mixture onto the parchment-lined pan. Then spread it into the corners and continue to spread it out. Coat the top of the marshmallows with some of the cornstarch and let the marshmallows set in a cool, dry place. Theyll need about 3 hours, but they can rest for 12 hours or more. Once they are cool and set, cut the marshmallows with a long thin knife or a cookie cutter, dipping the knife or cookie cutter in cornstarch between each cut. Have a bowl with the remaining cornstarch at hand and cut the marshmallows as youd like. As each piece is cut, drop it into the bowl. When youve got 4 or 5 marshmallows in the bowl, reach in with your fingers and turn the marshmallows to coat them with starch, then, one by one, toss the marshmallows from one hand to the other to shake off the excess starch; transfer them to a serving bowl or plastic baggie. Cut and coat the rest of the batch. You can serve these immediately, or store them for a few days (Ive heard they keep up to 12 days, but I havent tested the theory). These would be awesome in hot chocolate or coffee, or just scarfed down by the handful. Enjoy!",

        "Soak the chestnuts overnight, or cover with boiling water and leave to cool, in order to make the outer shells easy to peel. Peel off the outer shells. Put the peeled chestnuts in a bowl of water so they don't dry out. Put the peeled chestnuts in a pot, add enough water to cover them completely plus 1 tablespoon of bicarbonate of soda. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat enough so that the chestnuts don't bounce around in the water, and simmer for 10 minutes. Take off any scum diligently. Take the pot off the heat and into the sink. Run cold water into the pot from the tap until the water in the pot has been changed. (If you try to drain the chestnuts into a colander they may fall apart.) When the water is clear, rub each chestnut in the water one by one. If there are any thick fibers, take them off carefully with a toothpick. Put the washed chestnuts in a bowl filled with water so they don't dry out. If they do dry out they may break apart. After the chestnuts are clean, repeat steps 4 through 8 once again. For the 3rd simmering, use water only and leave out the bicarbonate of soda. Put the clean chestnuts in clear water, bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. If the chestnuts are still hard after simmering them with bicarbonate of soda twice, use the soda for the third simmering too (1 tablespoon). Change the water in the same way again, clean the chestnuts, soak them in water, and then clean the pot too. Put the chestnuts back in the pot. Don't add any water. Add sugar on top of the chestnuts to coat them. Heat over very low heat, and let the sugar melt slowly. When the sugar starts to melt, tilt and swirl the pan so as not to damage the chestnuts, to mix the melted and unmelted sugar and to help the unmelted sugar along. When the sugar has completely melted, take the pot off the heat (don't over-cook it). Leave at room temperature overnight to let the flavors penetrate. If you are adding brandy or rum, add it at the end, and bring briefly to a boil. The next day, some moisture will have come out of the chestnuts overnight, so re-heat the pot to even out the syrup. Transfer the chestnuts to another container. Put the pot with the syrup only back on low heat, and bring to a boil. (If there are any lumps of sugar on the bottom, melt them.) Take off the heat and leave to cool, and transfer to storage containers. Done. They taste best after being kept for 3 days at room temperature. (The day in step 16 is the first day.) For every 1 kg of chestnuts, about 10 to 15% is the outer shell, so they will be 850 to 900 g after peeling. If you use the same amount of sugar in weight as the chestnuts after peeling, it will just about cover the chestnuts when simmering. Chestnuts cooked in sugar syrup only, do last longer than ones cooked with added water, but try to eat them up as soon as you can. I divide the chestnuts into small portions that can be eaten in one sitting, put them in jars with the syrup and freeze them. By defrosting them naturally, you can enjoy them even after a year. The most important key is to use good chestnuts. Chestnuts that have been picked before they're ripe or old chestnuts will be tough no matter how long they are simmered.",

Spread the flour on a plate and turn the shanks in the flour, shaking off any excess. In a large, heavy ovenproof pot over high heat, warm 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Add the shanks (in batches, if necessary) and brown well on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer the shanks to a plate. Wipe out the pot. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until soft, 3-4 minutes. Return the shanks to the pot along with the potatoes, carrots, garlic, bay leaves, thyme, wine, and stock. Bring to a boil, cover, and transfer to the oven. Bake for 1 1/2 hours. Uncover and continue to bake until the Iamb is very tender, about 30 minutes longer. Transfer the shanks to a platter. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the potatoes and carrots to the platter. Cover and keep warm. Using a large spoon, skim off any fat from the surface of the sauce remaining in the pot. Lift out and discard the bay leaves and the thyme. Place the pot over high heat and bring to a boil. Cook the sauce until it reduces and is lightly thickened, 3-5 minutes. Pour the sauce around the meat.

Once the chicken is no longer pink (but still is not done), add onions, garlic and cilantro. Stir and continue to cook. After onions are nice and soft and chicken is fully cooked, add water (or olive juice) and lime juice. Add homemade seasoning mix. Stir and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally. At this time you can also add diced bell peppers, if you want to. Add salt and pepper to taste. Chicken is done when still juicy but excess juice has cooked down. Place chicken in warmed tortillas. Add lettuce, cheese, salsa, etc if desired. Homemade seasoning is perfect as taco seasoning for one pound of ground meat as well!",

        "First lets set up our ingredients. Set your butter out and allow it to reach room temperature. This isnt a must but it does allow the butter to mix more easily. In a small dish, zest the lemon and set the zest aside to be added later. In a measuring cup, juice the lemon you just zested and additional lemon(s) until you reach 2/3 a cup ; set cup aside. In a small bowl, crack the eggs and add the egg yolks, then set the bowl aside. In a small to medium-sized pot, add in your butter and sugar and mix well with a hand mixer. When butter and sugar are combined, add in the lemon juice and mix some more. Then add the eggs and mix until all ingredients are combined. At this point your mixture is going to look like a strange cottage cheese egg mixture. THIS IS OKAY! Put the pot on low heat and stir constantly while butter melts. You might start to think the butter is your egg whites, its not. Once butter is fully melted and mixture looks creamy. turn heat to medium and continue to stir until mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. It will all take about 15 minutes of stirring constantly and you will start to think its not working, but it is. When mixture has thickened, remove from heat and stir in lemon zest if desired (again this is not a have-to but you might want to do it). Pour lemon curd into a small bowl and allow to cool in fridge or serve hot (which is how I like it) over biscuits. Tip: Do not let your curd boil. If you start to see bubbles, turn the heat down or remove from the heat completely. Put Saran wrap over the top of your curd while in the fridge so that you dont get a skin to form. It wont hurt it but some people just dont like the skin.",

The fish is done when the skewer goes in easily and, when removed, feels slightly warm to your lip. ). Place 1/2 cup of the beans in a food processor with the reserved bean-cooking liquid and puree until smooth to make the sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, wrap a few kitchen towels around the bowl and place it in a warm, draft free area. Let the bowl sit there for twenty-four hours. After 24 hours, the cream mixture should have the consistency of a firm yogurt. It should not move when the bowl is tilted to the side. If the mixture still has some movement the culture needs more time to develop. Let it sit for another 6-12 hours if so. Day 2: Pour the mixture into a colander that youve lined with cheese cloth and set the colander over a bowl. Allow it to drain for 15 minutes, then fold the cheese cloth over the cheese. Drain the whey out of the catch bowl and discard it. Place the colander back over the bowl. Cover it with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for 12-14 hours. Day 3: Remove the cheese curd from the refrigerator and pour it into a mixing bowl. The cream cheese should be much firmer now. Stir in salt to taste. Line your colander with a piece of fresh cheese cloth. Pour the curd back into the colander. Wrap the colander with plastic wrap and place it back over your catch bowl. Place the colander/bowl back in the refrigerator and let it sit for 36-48 hours, depending on the firmness you desire for your cream cheese. Day 5: Place the finished cream cheese in a plastic or glass container and store in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.",

        "Preheat the oven to 160C fan/170C/gas mark 4. Grease the Battenberg tin really well with butter, then coat it with flour. If you have no Battenberg tin, see step 3. If using a square cake tin, grease and line it with non-stick baking parchment. Fold a pleat down the centre of the parchment (it should look like an upside-down T shape) and use the parchment to divide the tin into two halves. Pulse the pistachio kernels in a food processor until very fine. Alternatively place them in a bag and hit them with a rolling pin until finely crushed. Weigh your empty mixing bowl and make a note of it. In the mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until pale and fluffy; this takes about 5 minutes in a kitchen mixer fitted with a paddle, or a little longer with a hand mixer. Slowly add the eggs to the creamed butter and sugar, along with 1 tablespoon of the flour, mixing all the time until incorporated. Fold in the remaining flour until well mixed. Weigh the mixing bowl and subtract the weight of the empty bowl. You can now work out how much mixture you have. Place half of the mixture into another bowl. Fold the ground pistachios and a hint of green colouring into one half of the mixture until well blended and evenly coloured. Add the rose water (or vanilla essence) and a hint of the pink colouring to the other half of the mixture and fold in until well blended and evenly coloured. Place the pink mixture in one half of the tin and the pistachio mixture in the other half. Bake for 3035 minutes until well risen and a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean. Remove from the oven and leave to cool completely in the tin. Lightly dust your work surface with icing sugar and roll out the marzipan to about 3mm thick. You need a piece about 35 x 25cm to cover the cake. Remove the two sponges from the tin. Cut each sponge in half lengthways. Gently warm the strawberry jam in a small pan or the microwave. Use the warmed jam to stick together the four strips of cake to make a chequerboard effect. Trim one long side of your marzipan straight, using a ruler and knife. Brush the top and sides of the assembled cake with jam and place upside down on the straight edge of your rolled-out marzipan. Brush the bottom of the cake with jam and now roll the cake over until completely covered in marzipan. Trim away the excess marzipan and trim the ends of the cake using a sharp serrated knife. Place on your presentation plate and enjoy.",

It will gradually come together if you knead it by throwing it on a hard surface. The dough should be smooth like this photo. I threw this dough on a hard surface about 20 times. It would be the best if you leave it to rest for about an hour! Dust the work surface with a little cake flour, and divide the dough to shape into balls. You can make 6~8 balls.

At the same time, raise the heat on the milk mixture to medium, add the cheese, and gradually stir in the corn starch. Try to avoid clumping. Adjust heat as necessary to gently bring the sauce to a boil. The goal is for both to finish at about the same time. Use additional corn starch if necessary to adjust thickness of sauce. Ensure you allow it to boil momentarily between addtions to allow it to congeal sufficiently. Add the shrimp to the sauce and allow the sauce to gently boil for approximately 7 or 8 minutes with the shrimp in it. When the pasta pot is at a boil, add the fettucini, ensuring all of it is submerged, and continue to boil it to completion. Bear in mind that fettucini cooks much faster than spaghetti, so avoid overcooking. I generally remove it as soon as possible after it loses the rubbery texture (assuming you started with dried fettucini as opposed to fresh made).

        "I recommend using good quality chocolate for both the melting and the chips; I use Ghirardelli. Also, toffee chips are available in bags for baking, either Skor or Heath (I prefer the latter), but if you cant find them, you can always finely chop or process a Heath bar in the food processor! I can not stress this enough, and this is the reason why I labeled this recipe as intermediate: the cookies will not look done when they come out. In fact, they will seem underdone and will still be incredibly soft. They will have lost most of their shininess, but will be so soft it will almost look like they are about to deflate. However, trust me, if your oven is truly 350F, and you use a #40 scoop (scraping off excess dough), they should be ready to come out of the oven at right around 12 minutes, even if they are so soft they are souffle-like. You need to leave them on the cookie sheet outside of the oven for an additional 5 minutes to continue baking before removing them to a cooling rack to cool and harden further. The thing is, these cookies harden. A lot. And if you dont take them out while they are still underdone, you will end up with chocolate hazelnut hockey pucks. Which isnt tragicthey will still taste goodbut the consistency will be off a little. I know, I know, it is a leap of faith for me too every time I pull them out of the oven at 12 minutes, but it always ends up being the right call. Unfortunately, youll have to wait until the cookies fully cool down to believe this, because they will be soft right up until they achieve room temperature. But trust me. 1. Preheat oven to 350F. 2. Spread hazelnuts (for the mix-ins) onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet and toast at 350F for 10-15 minutes, keeping close watch on them. 3. For the batter, cream together butter and sugars until fluffy 4. Add in eggs and vanilla and combine. 5. Add in melted chocolate and combine. 6. Combine dry ingredients (flour, baking power, baking soda and salt) into a bowl, and add to wet ingredients, mixing until combined. 7. Add the mix-ins (toasted hazelnuts, oatmeal, chocolate chips, toffee bits) and stir until combined. 8. Use a #40 scoop to scoop dough onto a cookie sheet, and bake for about 12 minutes (cookies will still look underdone and too soft when done). 9. Cool on the pan for at least 5 minutes before removing to racks. 10. Let cool completely before storing.",

Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces, flavor with salt and pepper, and coat with the katakuriko. Don't use too much, just enough for a light coating. Brush off any excess. Add the dashi, sake, and mirin (the ratios should be 7:3:1 respectively) and the soy sauce to a pot and bring to a boil. Add the chicken from step 2 to the pot one at a time, and boil on low heat until fully cooked. Be careful not to let the chicken stick to the bottom of the pot. Once boiled, transfer to a serving plate together with the side vegetables and it's done. Addendum: When I made this before, I felt the flavor was a little too thick, so I adjusted the amount of soy sauce from 1 tablespoon to 1/2-1 tablespoon.

Add grated ginger to the green onion. 4. In a large frying pan, heat the oil over medium heat. 5. Once the oil is shimmering but not smoking, add the green onion and ginger. 6. Cook the green onion and ginger for one minute. If desired, you can add some salt to taste. 7. Remove the pan from the heat and let cool. 8. Store in the fridge for up to 1 week. For the longest time, I thought this was a Japanese condiment. My Gichan (grandfather) would prepare it, my mom would make it, and now Tomiko and I make it. My cousins on the Japanese side of our family also make it, so I thought it was only natural that it was Japanese. Recently I learned that this is really a Chinese condiment that the Japanese side of my family wholeheartedly embraced. My favourite way of eating it is to add 2-3 teaspoons to cold silken tofu, drizzle some sesame oil and shoyu (soy sauce) over it, and eat it as a cold, refreshing starter in the summer. This is a very flexible recipe, so feel free to adjust the ingredient amounts depending on your taste. One of my cousins likes for it to be mostly ginger with only a bit of green onion. Some like it with half and half, and another cousin likes to add a lot more oil. Since chopping the green onions can be a bit of a chore, I usually make a triple batch and freeze the extra in an ice cube tray. After the cubes are frozen, I store them in a freezer bag and then pop out the cubes as needed, refreshing them with a little drizzle of oil.",

Then add flour and sea salt and mix until smooth and elastic using a mixer on medium speed. Alternately you can mix everything by hand and knead until smooth and elastic. Cover dough and allow it to rest for 30 minutes. On a floured surface divide dough into four equal sized pieces. Divide each fourth into six pieces each. Roll each section of dough into a 6-8 inch long rope. The shorter the rope the thicker and chewier the breadsticks, the longer the rope the thinner and crunchier. In a food processor add Parmesan cheese, oregano, rosemary and thyme. Pulse until mixture is crumbly and resembles bread crumbs. Place in a large dish. Mix butter and the fresh and powdered garlic in a large dish. Dip each piece of breadstick dough into butter and then into cheese mixture. Place on an ungreased cookie sheet about 3 inches apart. At this point breadsticks can be covered and refrigerated for up to a day until ready to use or cooked immediately.

JUST A QUICK NOTE ABOUT THIS STEP -- The longer the dish sits, the thicker the dish will be after baking. Setting it aside for at least 20 minutes will result in a cobbler-like consistency. But if you prepare this dish in advance (several hours to even a day ahead of time) and letting it chill in the refrigerator (covered) will result in a thicker, quiche-like consistency. Bake at 350 for 50-55 minutes. Remove the baking dish from the oven, and let the dish stand for about 10 minutes before serving.

Break the eggs into a separate bowl and beat until blended. Check the oil by dropping in a pinch of the flour mixture, If the oil bubbles rapidly around the flour, it's ready. Dip each piece of chicken into the egg, then coat generously with the flour mixture. Once the chicken is coated, it should be placed on a rack to allow the pieces to dry, which may take 20 to 30 minutes. Allowing the pieces to dry will provide for more even browning of the chicken. To fry, heat oil in a heavy skillet over a medium-high burner until the oil is very hot. Place the chicken pieces in the hot oil, skin side down, one piece at a time. Leave enough space between pieces so that they are not crowded. This allows the pieces to cook and brown more evenly. Continue to cook over a medium heat, turning until all sides are golden brown and the meat is cooked thoroughly. As the pieces finish cooking, they should be removed from the pan and placed on a paper towel to allow grease to drain.",

Heat, stirring often, over medium heat until the fruit starts to release its juice, about 5 minutes. Bring the liquid to a low boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover, allowing the fruit to simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until it is very soft. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the fruit to cool. Using a blender or immersion blender, puree the fruit and its juice until smooth. Line two rimmed cookie sheets with silicone mats or parchment paper and spread the fruit puree out on the lined sheets to as even a thickness as possible. I made mine as thin as I could without leaving holes just so it would dry a bit quicker. Place the cookie sheets in the oven at 170 F and let the fruit dry for 5-7 hours, rotating the sheets occasionally so that it dries evenly. It is finished when it is a bit tacky to the touch, but not sticky or wet at all. Place a layer of plastic wrap over top of the fruit leather on the silicone mat and flip it over, then peel off the silicone mat. You can then cut the fruit and plastic wrap together into strips and roll them up. This makes about 12-16 roll-ups, depending on how big you cut the strips. These keep very well in a sealed container at room temperature.",

        "A note on ingredients: a small can of diced green chiles works fine. The original recipe called for 2 seeded chopped jalapenos, so I think any hot pepper would work. I use the pre-cleaned frozen shrimp and they are fine for this recipe, you don't need anything fancy. If I am making pineapple salad, I use fresh pineapple in this recipe. Otherwise, I use canned crushed pineapple. Start by placing the shrimp in a large self-close bag or medium glass bowl. Add the peppers, garlic, ginger, honey, soy sauce, and coconut milk. Allow to marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 4 hours. In a large skillet over medium heat, combine olive oil, salt, onions, and bell peppers. Cook until vegetables become slightly soft, but not browned. Turn heat up to high and place the shrimp (not the marinade, just the shrimp) in the skillet. Saute, turning once, until shrimp are just slightly browned on the outside and turning pink. You want them slightly undercooked. Remove shrimp, onions, and peppers from the skillet. Pour the marinade into the skillet and bring it to a boil. Boil it for 5 minutes. This is long enough to cook the \"shrimp juice\" that got into the marinade and also to thicken the sauce. Turn the heat off. Add the shrimp mixture back to the skillet. Add the basil and green onions. Toss to combine. Serve immediately over rice. Rice:. In a small covered saucepan, combine the rice, coconut milk, and stock (or water). Use up the rest of the can of coconut milk, and add enough additional liquid to total 1.5 cups. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat. Cook covered. Simmer for 12-15 minutes. Add pineapple. Fluff with a fork.",

Put the tin on a piece of greaseproof paper and draw around it with a pencil. Cut the circle out and press it into the bottom of the tin. Brush with a little more oil. Put the flours, baking powder, margarine, 1 tblsp of the milk, the sugar and the vanilla essence into a food processor. Crack the eggs into a small bowl, then pour the egg into the flour mixture. Put the lid on the food processor and turn the machine on for just two minutes or until everything is mixed together. (Don't leave it running too long, or the cake will not rise. ). Put about 1/3 of the cake mixture in a bowl, add a few drops of food colouring, and mix it evenly with a spoon. Put another 1/3 of the mixture in another bowl, and add the cocoa powder and the rest of the milk. Mix well. Put a tablespoon of white cake mixture in the cake tin, then add a spoonful of chocolate mixture, followed by a spoonful of pink mixture. Keep doing this until all of the cake mixtures are in the tin. Using a round-bladed knife, make the shape of an eight right through the mixture. This helps to mix the colours together. Level the surface of the mixture in the tin. Bake the cake in the oven for about 1 hour, or until the cake is golden-brown on the top. press the cake very gently on top. if it is cooked, it will spring back into shape. Carefully run a knife around the edge of the cake between the cake and the tin, then turn the cake on to a wire rack to cool. Peel the greaseproof paper off the bottom. When the cake is cold, you can decorate it. break the chocolate into squares, and put it in a heatproof bowl. Put a little water in a saucepan and heat until it simmers. Stand the bowl over the water (the bowl should not touch the water), and turn the heat down to very low.

        "place bottle of vodka in freezer several hours before beginning this recipe! lightly spray bundt pan or jello mold with non stick cooking spray. wipe off excess spray with a paper towel. a slight residue should remain, just enough to help unmold the jello, without affecting the taste or appearance. pour 3/4 cup water into a sauce pan and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of the plain gelatin. Allow gelatin to soak for a minute or two. heat over low heat, stirring constantly, until gelatin is dissolved (about 5 minutes). wish in the first package of flavored gelatin. wish for at least 2 minutes, or until completely dissolved (i find the sugar free mix dissolves much faster than the regular) remove from heat. add 1/2 cup of the cold vodka and stir to combine. pour 3/4 cup of the gelatin into the prepared mold and place in refrigerator. allow to set for 20 to 30 minutes, until the jello is a little firm, but still sticks when touched. very important - if the layer sets up too much, the next layer wont bond to it. refrigerate the remaining gelatin mixture in a bowl for about 5 minutes or until slightly thickened (consistency of unbeaten egg whites). gradually stir in 3 tablespoons of yogurt and stir until well blended. this cooling step is also important - the gelatin must be cooled to room temperature before adding on top of the layers or the layers will not be well defined. gently spoon the gelatin/yogurt mixture over set gelatin and return to the refrigerator. refrigerate about 15 minutes or until gelatin is set but not firm (again, it should stick to your finger when touched). as the layers progress, the setting time will become shorter as the gelatin in the pan becomes colder and the layers become thinner as more are added to the mold. repeat steps with remaining jello flavors for a total of 12 alternating clear and creamy layers. after completing all the layers, refrigerate the jello overnight. this will allow the layers to completely bond. to unmold, fill a large container or clean sink with warm water. with clean fingers, loosen the jello around the edges of the mold. next dip the almost to the edge into the warm water for just a few seconds. dry the bottom of the mold with a towel and check the edges to see if they are loose. if not, repeat the dip process. place a plate on top of the mold and invert.",

If the pit has made the inside really brown or red (rotten) throw the avocado out because it will likely make you sick. Pluck out the vein root looking things if you see any in your bowl. Smush the 3 avocados till their broken down but still chunky. Add in the Italian dressing and then smush them more. Once they are at your desired smushedness, I like it a bit chunky but not too much.. Add a little bit of the onion powder. Stir. Taste. Then add the curry powder. I always like this dip cold as the (mild) curry makes the dip warm you up (in filling and delicious not hot and spicy sort of way) however avocados usually taste more fresh at cooler temperatures. So you can either make this recipe by chilling the avocados in the fridge prior or adding a tiny bit of lemon juice and then putting it in the fridge right after you finish. This recipe requires you eat it with Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps: Original Deli Style. For health benefits as well as the overall taste.

        "Cook the lentils in 400 ml boiling water. After 8 minutes drain off the boiling water. To make the tomato sauce, fry the chopped onion, carrot, and celery with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add the consomme powder and tinned tomato, along with water from swishing clean the tin, and cook for 20-30 minutes. Season to taste with balsamic vinegar and herbs. Add salt and pepper if necessary. To boil the lasagna, add 1 tablespoon each of salt and olive oil to the boiling water. Add about 3 sheets of lasagna at a time and boil. The olive oil prevents the pasta from sticking to each other. Grease the gratin dish with oil. Layer it first with lasagne, then the cooked lentils, and sprinkle with herb salt and pepper. Place 2 teaspoons each of mascarpone and sour cream on top. Sprinkle with 2 teaspoons Parmesan cheese and pour the tomato sauce over the top. Repeat with two more layers (adjust to the height of your dish). Pour in 3 tablespoons of milk slowly from the edges and cover the dish with aluminum foil. Put the dish in a oven preheated to 200C. After 15 minutes, remove the aluminum foil and bake for 4 more minutes. Open the oven door and let it stand for 5-10 minutes. This helps set the cheese to make it easier to eat. Instead of mascarpone and sour cream, I used 125 ml double cream. I also used a mixture of pecorino cheese and Parmesan cheese. You could also mix the tomato sauce and cooked lentils beforehand, which is also tasty. For a related recipe, see: 'Mascarpone and Vegetable Lasagna'.",

Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it reaches 240 degrees F. This will take awhile, but dont wander too far away, as the temperature seems to rise quickly right at the end. Once it reaches 240F, take the pot off heat and stir in the cinnamon oil and red coloring. Pour into your buttered pan. Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate to set. Take out of refrigerator and let sit for about 10 minutes before cutting. If you want to gift these caramels, simply cut them into your desired size and wrap in wax paper. Notes: *I used cinnamon oil from a Wilton candy flavorings multi pack, found at Michaels. Cinnamon oil is very strong, but necessary for reaching a stronger cinnamon flavor. Be careful to not get it on your skin, as it can cause irritation. For a more subtle cinnamon flavor, substitute 3 teaspoons of cinnamon extract for the cinnamon oil. The extract can be found in the baking section of your grocery store. *For the red coloring, I used Wilton red no taste icing color, found at Michaels. *Using candy thermometers can be a tricky thing. Thermometers can vary quite a bit, which can give you different results. When Mom makes these caramels, she cooks them to 236 degrees F, as her thermometer registers a bit differently than mine. If you want to calibrate your thermometer, to know exactly where yours sits, I found a great tutorial over at OurBestBites.com.",

        "In a large saucepan, combine the milk, water, butter, sugar and salt. Bring to a slow simmer over medium heat and let the butter fully melt. Remove from heat and add the flour. Whisk the flour into the liquid and return to the heat for one minute, stirring continuously. Remove from heat and place the mixture in the bowl of a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Turn the mixer on and add the eggs one at a time, allowing each to fully incorporate before adding the next. Once the batter is smooth and no lumps remain, place the batter in a large piping bag fitted with a large round tip. Or if youd like, use a regular bag and snip a hole in the corner of the bag, about 1/2 inch in diameter. Preheat your oven to 375 F. Line two baking sheets with parchment. I flipped over the parchment prior to piping and used a drinking glass to trace the 3-inch rounds with a pencil. I then flipped the parchment over and piped within the traced rounds. Set one of the baking sheets aside. On the first baking sheet, pipe the batter into rounds, about 3 inches in diameter. Sprinkle half of the 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar over the tops of the dough, reserving the second half for the second batch. You should be able to safely get 12 rounds on each pan. Pipe the second pan of pastries only after the first have come out of the oven. Put the first sheet into the heated oven. Bake the rounds for 35-40 minutes, until a very dark golden brown. Remove pan from oven and set it on a rack. Repeat with the second sheet of dough rounds. Allow them to cool completely before filling. To fill: In a medium sized bowl, whip the cream, sugar and extract using a mixer until stiff peaks form. Put the mixture into a pastry bag that has been fitted with a small round tip. Pierce a small hole in the bottom of the pastry (I used a chopstick) and insert the pastry tip. Fill each puff with cream, sprinkle the top with confectioners sugar and almonds and serve. These can be made up to 6 hours in advance. You can also freeze the puffs prior to filling with whipped cream if you need to make them ahead. Fill just prior to serving.

If you added in too many nuts and the dough won't come together, push down firmly with your hands and form it into a ball. This should enable you to shape the cookies.

Peel, seed and dice the tomatoes, setting aside 1 cup. In a heavy saucepan fitted with a lid, warm the oil over medium-high heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Add the chicken and brown on all sides, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Remove from the pan. Add the sausage, onion and garlic and saute until softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in the red pepper, tomatoes, thyme and bay leaves. Deglaze the pan with the wine and reduce until the pan is nearly dry. Add the chicken broth or water and bring to a boil. Tuck the chicken into the liquid and simmer, covered, until the chicken is tender and pulls easily from the bone, about 40 minutes. Set the chicken aside to cool and discard the bay leaves. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred the meat from the bone and return it to the pot. Reduce the broth until slightly thickened. Whisk in the butter and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Prepare the risotto: in a small pot, heat the chicken broth or water until warmed through. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat. When it starts to foam, add the leeks and stir until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the rice and stir for a couple of minutes to toast the grains. Stir in the wine and cook until absorbed. Begin adding the warmed broth, about a half-cup at a time, and cook at a faint simmer, adding more broth as it is absorbed, stirring all the while.

Drain chiles, discarding liquid, and puree in a blender with spices, garlic, herbs, vinegar, water, oil, and 2 teaspoon salt until very smooth, about 1 minute. Set aside 1/2 cup adobo for gravy. Rinse turkey inside and out and pat dry. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons salt evenly in turkey cavities and all over skin, then rub remaining adobo (a scant 3/4 cup) all over turkey, including cavities. Fold neck skin under body, then tuck wing tips under breast and tie drumsticks together with string. Transfer to rack in roasting pan and marinate, covered with plastic wrap and chilled, at least 8 hours and up to 24. Let turkey stand, covered, at room temperature 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350F with rack in lower third. Add 1 cup water to pan and roast turkey 1 hour. Brush turkey with oil and add remaining cup water, then tent loosely with foil and rotate pan. Roast (if bottom of pan becomes dry, add 1/2 cup more water) until an instant-read thermometer inserted into fleshy part of each thigh (test both; close to but not touching bone) registers 170F, 1 3/4 to 2 3/4 hours more (total roasting time: 2 3/4 to 3 3/4 hours). Carefully tilt turkey so juices from inside large cavity run into pan. Transfer turkey to a platter and let stand, uncovered, 30 minutes (temperature of thigh meat will rise to 175 to 180F). Straddle roasting pan across 2 burners, then add 1 cup turkey stock and boil over high heat, stirring and scraping up brown bits, 2 minutes. Strain pan juices through a fine-mesh sieve into 2-quart measure and skim off fat (or use a fat separator), reserving fat. Add enough turkey stock to liquid to bring total to 5 cups. Whisk together flour, 6 tablespoon reserved fat (if there is less, add melted butter), and reserved 1/2 cup adobo in a heavy medium saucepan, then cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, 3 minutes (mixture will be thick). Add pan juices and stock in a fast stream, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Bring to a boil, whisking, then simmer, whisking occasionally, until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt. Serve turkey with gravy.",

The butter is half the magic of these sweet rolls. Slather the pan. In a large mixing bowl, combine blueberries, 6 tablespoons sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice and zest. Gently stir to coat berries well. Set aside. For the sweet roll dough, I divide the dough in half, place it on a floured surface and roll out 2 long rectangles. In Rees recipe she suggests 30x10 inches. I just sort of eyeball it and roll it quite thin. Brush the dough generously with the melted butter. Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of sugar over top the melted butter on both rectangles ( 1/2 cup sugar over each separate rectangle). Spoon the blueberries out evenly over the top of the buttered/sugared dough. Roll the dough tightly toward you to form your dough logs. Once the log is rolled up, gently press the seam into the dough to seal. I like my sweet rolls to be on the taller side, so I slice my rolls in 1 1/2 inch slices. Make 3 rows of 3 if you are using a 9x13 baker. You need to give them room to spread. Cover them with a towel and let sit for 1/2 hour. Bake in a 375 degrees F oven until golden, about 18 to 20 minutes. For the glaze, mix all ingredients until smooth. Slather over sweet rolls as soon as they come out of the oven. This recipe makes a lot: two full 9x13 pans when sliced in 1 1/2 inch slices. Note: For the sweet dough recipe, I used Ree Drummonds recipe (the dough she uses for her cinnamon rolls), which is pretty darn perfect.

The following day, remove the chicken pieces from the marinade and place them on a plate. To another large Ziploc bag, add the flour, and season with a bit more salt and pepper. Take a couple of pieces of the chicken and add them to the Ziploc bag. Seal and give it a good shake, making sure you have coated the chicken with the flour. Remove, shaking off the chicken pieces to remove any excess flour, and place on a wire rack. Continue with the remaining pieces of chicken. To a large cast iron skillet, add about an inch of oil, being careful not to add too much as it will rise when you add the chicken. Heat on medium heat until the oil reaches about 360 degrees. Add in your pieces, placing the darker meat in the center of the skillet and carefully arrange the other pieces around the perimeter. If you have an oil splatter screen, use it, and just place onto the top of the skillet. Cook for about 4-6 minutes on each side. Dont mess with it and keep turning it, just let it be. Reduce the heat to a medium low after turning the second time around and let the chicken cook for about another 12-15 minutes. When the chicken is done, remove the pieces from the skillet, and place on a wire rack the let any excess oil drain. Plate and serve. I think my dinner table was pleasantly surprised when they bit into the chicken. Not only did it have the perfect crunch that you expect in great fried chicken, but it was packed full of great flavors. You really got great lemon, garlic and onion flavor in every bite.

        "Preheat your oven to 350 F and line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside. In the bowl of your stand mixer, with paddle attachment fixed, cream the butter, cookie spread and brown sugar. Mix until smooth. Add the eggs, vanilla extract and maple syrup, and mix again until smooth. In 1/2 cup increments, add the dry ingredients into the wet, until all of the flour mixture has been incorporated. If you find the dough to be too wet, add more flour (a tablespoon at a time) until you get a firm cookie dough. Gently fold in the chocolate chips and peppermint baking chips until they are evenly dispersed. Using a tablespoon-sized scoop, scoop 9 balls of dough onto each baking sheet (space them out evenly on the pan, leaving space between). Place both baking sheets into the oven (one on the top rack, one on the bottom rack) and bake for 10-12 minutes (swapping the sheets halfway though). The cookies are done when they look set but are still soft. Remove pans from oven and let the cookies stand on the baking sheet for 2-3 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool the rest of the way. Store the cookies in an airtight container for up to a week. Enjoy! This recipe will make 18 large cookies.",

        "Prepare cooked brown rice. This is 3 rice cooker cups (540 ml) of brown rice (measured before cooking) with 1/3 a rice cooker cup (60 ml; measured before cooking) of adzuki beans, cooked the usual way. Put the cooked brown rice and water in a sauce pan. Simmer for about 10 minutes, and it will become like rice porridge. Turn the heat off and let it cool down to 60C. Break the rice malt up with your hands and add it to the pan. Mix well to blend with the rice porridge. This is how it looks with the rice malt mixed into the porridge. Transfer this to the yogurt maker, and keep it warm (If you can set the temperature, set it to 50 to 60C). Taste it 12 hours later. If it's really sweet, switch the yogurt maker off. Mix the porridge up 2-3 times during these 12 hours. The rice grains and beans will still be intact. If you don't like it to be grainy, puree it in a blender. The result is a thick, creamy amazake cream that has a subtle adzuki bean taste. You can use this amazake cream as a sweetener in desserts and drinks a little at a time, so transfer it to a storage container and freeze immediately. Even if you freeze the amazake, it won't solidify due to the high sugar content. You can scoop out as much as you want to use in cooking. This is the koji (rice malt) I used.",

If you choose to do so in a stand mixer (or use a hand mixer) just beat until frothy, not soft peaks. 5. Combine the honey/maple syrup mixture into your frothy egg white and combine thoroughly. Pour your egg mixture over your oat mixture and combine completely. There will be a tendency for dried oats to sink to the bottom so make sure you mix very very well. 6. Once combined, divide your granola between your two cookie pans (or more if your pans are on the smaller side) and spread out so that its a nice 1/4-1/2 layer. No need to press down really. Just make sure its spread out nice and evenly. 7. Bake 15-20 minutes on the upper rack, turning your pans halfway through baking time to insure even browning and baking. Remove pans from oven, and flip and toss granola in pan breaking up any large pieces with a spatula. Make sure to bring the sides into the middle (they will want to brown quicker than the middle) and move the middle out. Stir and mix up well. Then spread out so its a single layer again. 8. Bake another 10 minutes or until your granola is crispy and a golden brown throughout. Again, watch the sides and bottom of granola. If its darkening too much, simply remove pan from oven, stir it again, and add back to oven. Dont wander off at this point. Granola can burn quickly so continue to check pans every now and then to prevent said burning. 9. Remove pans from oven and allow to cool completely. Once cooled, add granola to a large bowl and mix in your remaining 1 cup of coconut flakes. Then simply add to a large airtight container and munch away! * Will store at room temperature for up to 2 weeks. Can be added to a freezer proof airtight container and frozen for up to 3 months. To thaw, just place in refrigerator overnight and then allow to come to room temp! Makes approximately 11 cups. Serving size is about 3/4 cup.",

        "Rinse the soy beans, and soak them in plenty of water overnight. They will swell up to twice their size by the next day. Put the soy beans into twice their volume of water in a pressure cooker and bring to a boil. Skim off the white scum that rises to the surface. Put the perforated metal plate that comes with the pressure cooker on top. Lock the lid on and cook under pressure for 10 minutes, then leave to cool down naturally. *If you have a small pressure cooker, cook the soy beans in 2 batches. This is the fresh rice koji I ordered by mail and used this time. There are 2 bags containing 1.3 kg each. You can use dried rice koji instead! While the soy beans are cooking, mix the koji and salt together. Drain the cooking liquid from the cooked soy beans, and hold onto it to use later. *If you're cooking the soy beans in several batches, just keep the cooking liquid from the final batch. Let the soy beans cool a bit, and put them in a plastic bag. They'll be hot so wrap the bag in a towel and press down with your hands to mash them. The beans are very soft so this should be easy. Add the combined koji and salt from Step 5 to the mashed soy beans and mix well. Mix in some of the cooking liquid until the paste is about the consistency of hamburger mixture or about as soft as your earlobe. Line a large container or tub with a double layer of plastic bags. Roll the paste into apple sized balls (these are called miso balls) and throw them hard into the container. Press them in firmly to eliminate any air pockets. When all the miso balls have been put into the container, press down hard on the whole mass again while putting your weight into it to remove any air. Sprinkle a handful of salt on top evenly. (This is to prevent the surface from developing mold.) Squeeze the inner plastic bag closed while pushing out any air inside. Press a small lid or plate on top, add a weight on top of that and wrap and close the outer plastic bag over all. Cover with a lid. Wrap the whole container with another plastic bag. Leave it in a dark, cool place out of the sun. Here's the schedule from this point on: Mixing up from the bottom (1st time): Check on the miso after about 2 months to see if it has developed any mold! If it has, just remove the parts with the mold. Mix the whole thing up from the bottom after removing the moldy parts. Mixing up from the bottom (2nd time): Open up the miso 4 months after the first time you mixed it up! Mix it up from the bottom again. If the miso has matured enough when you mix it up the 2nd time you can start eating it, but it will become more delicious if you let it mature for a while longer. I made miso this time on February 3rd, the day of spring (Setsubun no Hi). I'm looking forward to how it will turn out. April 30th: The first mixing up! It's about 3 months after I made the miso. I opened the lid slowly since I was afraid it had developed mold. Looks so good! It's fluffy, and actually starting to smell like miso! It hadn't molded at all as I'd feared, and it's turned into miso. It's not yet edible at this point, though. I mixed it up from the bottom. To do this I took the plastic bag out and squeezed the miso over the bag. This way my hands are not in direct contact with the miso, so no bacteria gets into it. I returned the plastic bag to the container, and levelled out the surface with a wooden spatula. I closed up the plastic bags again as described above. I left it in a cool, dark place. I'll check on it again in September...maybe it will be ready to eat by then... End of August: It's matured into a delicious looking miso. It's ready to eat at this point. The top photo is of the miso at this stage.",

Place the patties on a parchment or foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Transfer the burgers to the oven and bake for 23 minutes until cooked through. While the burgers are baking, prepare the Sriracha-lime crema. In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream, lime juice and Sriracha. Taste and season with salt. Refrigerate until ready to use. Serve burgers warm with buns or in lettuce wraps. Make sure to drizzle them with with plenty of crema. Top with tomato, onion, avocado and a leaf of lettuce. Enjoy!",

Pour marinade mixture over the steak; cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours. If you put it into a bag, squeeze the excess air out so the marinade is touching the steak all over. Take the steak out of the refrigerator an hour before preparing so the meat can relax and absorb the flavors. Remove the steak from the marinade, reserving marinade. Sprinkle with black pepper if desired. If broiling, place on a rack in a broiler pan. Broil 5 1/2 inches from the heat for 5 minutes (if electric, leave the door open). Turn; brush with marinade. Broil an additional 4 to 6 minutes or to desired doneness. Sprinkle with pepper to taste. Slice steak diagonally across grain into slices to serve. If grilling, prepare charcoal and once your coals are medium high, place the steak on the grill. Grill for 4 minutes with the cover on the grill. Remove the cover and flip the steak.

        "With an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar together until they are fluffy. Beat in the egg and the milk/cream. Add vanilla. Add in the flour and salt at this point. Remove dough from the bowl onto a lightly floured surface. Knead dough briefly (not too long or it will be a tough cookie) and form into a ball. Wrap with plastic and chill in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes (or you can quick chill in the freezer for about 10). While dough is chilling, preheat the oven for 350F Take your mold and lightly brush oil on the baking surface of the cookie molds. Flour the mold(s) and tap out excess flour. Take a piece of dough and starting at one side, press it firmly into the mold, adding more dough as needed. Be sure to level the back of the cookie. Now, turn your mold over and strike it a couple of times to release the cookie. The cookie should come right out. Repeat the flour dusting of the mold before molding another cookie. (do not use oil again). Place the formed cookie on a baking sheet with detail side up and bake in the top 3rd of your oven. This helps highlight the nice detail of the cookie. Bake for about 10 to 12 minutes. HELPFUL HINTS. Don't be timid about striking the mold on a cutting board; it will not break if you hold it upright while striking it on its edge. If the cookie does not release, you have used too much oil. Clean the mold with a stiff dry brush, re-flour, but don't re-oil, and try again. If your cookies are puffing up and losing detail, use a smaller egg. If they are spreading out and losing detail, use less sugar. Chill the cookie mold as well to ease in the release of the cookie. If you are using a mold with multiple sections like the one in the photo, do one cookie section at at time - not the whole mold.",

Add a layer of no boil noodles, top with more sauce and the ricotta mixture. You can also add mozzarella into the layers if youd like it extra cheesy. Im not judging you. Continue adding layers until youve got enough or you run out of supplies (whichever comes first). Top it off with a ton of mozzarella (or a little if you dont like cheese very much).

Wrap disks in plastic and refrigerate at least 1 hour (and up to 3 days) before rolling out and baking. Heat oven to 425 degrees. Place larger dough disk on a lightly floured surface and roll into a 12-inch circle, about 3/8-inch thick. Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate. Line dough with foil and weigh it down with pie weights. Bake until crust is light golden brown, about 30 minutes. While pie crust is baking, prepare filling. In bowl of a food processor, combine sugar, tapioca and cinnamon (use more tapioca if you prefer a thicker, more solid filling, and less if you like a looser, juicier filling). Run the motor until tapioca is finely ground. Place cherries in a bowl and add sugar and tapioca mixture. Drizzle in kirsch or brandy and toss gently to combine. When pie crust is ready, transfer it to a wire rack to cool slightly and reduce heat to 375 degrees. Remove foil and weights. Scrape cherry filling into pie crust. Place smaller disk of dough on a lightly floured surface and roll it 3/8-inch thick. Use a round cookie cutter (or several round cookie cutters of different sizes) to cut out circles of dough.

The dough should be moist but firm enough that you can knead with your hands. Turn out the dough onto a well floured surface and knead for 15 minutes until smooth and elastic. Form into a ball and return the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp tea towel and let the dough rest for 30-45 minutes. Remove from bowl to a floured working surface and divide into 8 equal sized pieces. Form each into a small round roll. To form into rolls, repeatedly fold over the outer edges of the ball into towards the center of the ball, gently pressing down. Once the bottom side is round and smooth, turn it over so the smooth side is on top. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and evenly arrange the rolls. Lightly cover with a clean tea towel or baking cloth. Let rest in the refrigerator 8 hours. This helps the outer skin of the dough slightly dry out so it doesn't lose shape when boiling. After 8 hours when you're ready to bake, preheat the oven to 210C/410F. While the oven is preheating, prepare the baking soda bath to boil pretzels: Bring 1 liter/1 quart of water to a boil and add 5 teaspoons of baking soda (the ratio of water to baking soda is important! It's what gives the pretzels their distinct color and flavor). Plop the pretzel rolls into the water 1 or 2 at a time. You don't want to crowd them. Boil for 30 seconds on one side then flip over and boil for another 30-45 seconds. Remove the boiled pretzels from the pot with a slotted spoon and place on a rack to drain for a couple minutes. While the pretzels are still wet, cut a shallow \"X\" shape across the top of each rolls and sprinkle with coarse salt, poppy seeds and/or sesame seeds. When done, remove onto a rack and let cool for a few minutes. Serve with plenty of butter! Arrange the rolls on a baking sheet that has been lightly greased or covered with parchment paper. Bake in the oven at 210C/410F. for 18-20 minutes, or until they pretzels turn a deep, golden brown color.",

When they are tender, remove the dried mushrooms from the liquid with a slotted spoon, reserving the liquid; slice or chop if the pieces are large. Meanwhile, set a pot of water to boil for the broccoli. Cook the broccoli for 2 minutes in the boiling water, then drain. Put a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; add the oil and swirl it around, then add the garlic and ginger. Cook for 15 seconds; add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to soften and brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the fresh mushrooms and dried mushrooms when theyre ready, and allow them to cook down 2 or 3 minutes before adding the carrots and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender but not at all mushy, 10 to 12 minutes. Add the broccoli during the last five minutes of cooking. If you like, dissolve the cornstarch in the soy sauce to thicken it; stir into the pan, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Add the crushed red pepper if youre using it, and pour in the soaking liquid. Stir the mixture, and scrape the bottom of the pan, then turn off the heat; the liquid should be mostly absorbed.

        "First you must cook your corn. Cook it for 10 minutes or so in a big pot of boiling water. Then remove it from the water and set aside while you get everything ready. In a large bowl combine your shrimp, zest and juice of lemon, thyme, parsley, salt and pepper. Cover the bowl and put it in your fridge until ready to use. Skewer your cherry tomatoes onto metal or pre-soaked wooden skewers. Put skewers on a large baking sheet. Lay out your pepper, jalapeno, cooked corn, and sliced onion. Drizzle everything with a little bit of olive oil, add a touch of salt and pepper. Time to start the grill, heating it to medium-high heat. Once grill is nice and hot add your vegetables and do not leave them alone. Make sure everything gets beautiful grill marks on all sides. Have a clean baking sheet ready and depending on time and heat, remove the vegetables once they are softened and done to your liking. You need to pay attention because most likely the tomatoes will be ready first and start bursting. Turn each veggie around so they get color all over. When they are all done and removed from the grill, set them aside to cool for a few minutes (they will be too hot to handle right now). Turn grill off for now. Meanwhile back to the shrimp! Skewer your shrimp for the grill. Set aside. When your veggies are a touch cooler, its time to chop everything. Chop your onion, peppers (remove stem and seeds), tomatoes (make sure to keep all the juices) and cut corn off the cobs. Heat the tablespoon of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add all your vegetables (and juices) and toss everything together. Let this cook on medium-low for about 10 minutes. Add the heavy cream and butter. Mix everything well and cook for another 5 minutes, on low. Keep warm until ready to serve. Heat up your grill again, to medium heat. When hot, add the shrimp skewers. Stay put...these should only take about 5 minutes total; make sure to turn them halfway through. Do not over-cook your shrimp or you may as well eat rubber! Put your Maque Choux into your serving bowl, top with shrimp and a nice thick piece of grilled bread. Dig in!",

        "Line a 9-by-9-inch baking pan with plastic wrap, overlapping as needed to completely cover the bottom and sides and leaving at least a 5-inch overhang. (If possible, use a pan that does not have sloping sides.) Drop the sorbet in large dollops into the pan and spread to the edges with a rubber spatula. Cover with the overhanging plastic wrap and press on the surface of the sorbet with the bottom of a measuring cup until its packed into a smooth, even layer. Freeze until solid, at least 3 hours. Meanwhile, line 2 baking sheets with parchment or waxed paper. Tape each corner of the paper down and place the baking sheets in the freezer. When the sorbet is solid, remove the pan and 1 baking sheet from the freezer. Grasping the plastic wrap, pull the sorbet slab out of the pan and place it on a cutting board. Remove and discard the plastic wrap. Slice the slab into 9 even squares. Using a flat spatula, transfer and evenly space the squares on the baking sheet. Freeze until solid, at least 2 hours. Fill a large bowl with 2 inches of cold water, add 3 to 4 ice cubes, and set aside. Bring a medium saucepan filled with 1 to 2 inches of water to a simmer over high heat; once simmering, reduce the heat to low and maintain a bare simmer. Place 24 ounces of the chocolate in a large, dry, heatproof bowl. Set the bowl over the saucepan and stir with a rubber spatula until the chocolate is completely melted and has reached 118 degrees F. (Make sure the chocolate does not come into contact with any water or exceed 120 degrees F. If either happens, start over, as the chocolate is no longer usable.) Remove the bowl from the saucepan. Add the remaining 8 ounces of chocolate and stir constantly, scraping against the bottom of the bowl, until all of the chocolate has melted and the temperature has cooled to 80 degrees F. To speed the cooling process, after all of the chocolate has melted you can place the bowl over the reserved cold-water bath. Return the bowl to the saucepan and stir until the chocolate reaches 88 degrees F; immediately remove from heat. Do not remove the thermometer from the bowl; check the temperature periodically to make sure it stays between 87 degrees F and 89 degrees F. (The chocolate must remain in this temperature range or it will not set up properly.) Keep the saucepan over low heat and use it to reheat the chocolate as necessary. To test if the chocolate is properly tempered, spread a thin layer on parchment or waxed paper and place it in the refrigerator for 3 minutes to set. If the chocolate hardens smooth and without streaks, it is properly tempered. (If it is not properly tempered, let the melted chocolate harden and start the tempering process over again: Bring the chocolate up to 118 degrees F, then down to 80 degrees F, then up again to 88 degrees F.) Have a fork and flat spatula ready. Remove the empty baking sheet and the baking sheet with the sorbet squares from the freezer. Working quickly, use the flat spatula to drop 1 sorbet square into the chocolate. Using the fork, flip the square, making sure the edges are covered in chocolate. Lift the square out of the chocolate with the fork and tap the fork several times on the edge of the bowl to even out the coating. Scrape the bottom of the fork against the edge of the bowl to remove any excess chocolate. Place the coated square on the empty baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining squares and chocolate, tilting the bowl as needed to pool the chocolate in one area, and spacing the squares as close together as possible on the baking sheet without touching. (If the sorbet squares start to melt, return them to the freezer until firm before continuing.) Freeze the dipped sorbet bars until the chocolate coating has hardened and the sorbet is solid, at least 2 hours. Wrap them individually in plastic wrap, then foil, and store in the freezer for up to 2 weeks.",

Do not try to turn them until they begin to unstick from the grill, 3 or 4 minutes. Turn kebabs and grill the other side 3 or 4 minutes; turn. Continue cooking and turning until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 6 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",

        "Thoroughly chill thedough in the refrigerator for more than 30 minutes. Use your choice of cookie dough (to yield about 400 g of dough). I recommend this dough, however, since it is very easy to make and does not become hard. Crush the walnuts into bite sized pieces and spread them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Roast them for 15 minutes in an oven set to 340F/170C. Once the walnuts cool to the touch, chop them vertically and horizontally into 5-8 mm pieces. Cut the cranberries into small pieces. If you prefer a stronger berry flavor, add 30 g more cranberries. Combine the walnuts and cranberries, and set them aside in a bowl. Combine all of the ingredients in a pan (I recommend using a pan that doesn't burn easily). To bake, generally, the baking tray is first lined with a sheet of parchment paper, but instead, I recommend placing the parchment paper over the dough, then flipping it over onto the baking tray. On your working surface, lay out a sheet of plastic wrap larger than the size of your baking tray, and place the dough from Step 1 on top, then place another sheet of plastic wrap over the dough. I recommend placing a thin board underneath the plastic wrap under the dough to make the following steps easier. Roll out the dough with a rolling pin to a size slightly larger than your desired baking size. Remove the plastic wrap from the top, then trim the dough into your desired baking size. While it depends on your taste, the florentine will be crispier and easier to eat if the dough is rolled thinly (about 3-4 mm). Place a sheet of parchment paper slightly larger than the baking tray over the rolled out dough, then gently roll your rolling pin over it to make the parchment paper stick to the dough. Let the dough sit for 15 minutes in the fridge or in the freezer to harden. Since the cookie dough is thin and large, this will make it easier to arrange on the baking sheet. Once the cookie dough hardens, flip it over onto the baking sheet with the parchment paper still attached to the dough. I actually roll the dough on my rolling pin and spread it on the baking tray after Step 11, but if that sounds too tricky, I recommend following Steps 9-15, which is easier. I recommend chilling the dough after rolling it to make it easier to spread out (and flip over) the dough. Poke holes randomly in the dough after placing it on the baking tray. This will prevent the dough from rising and will help it bake flat. Bake Step 18 for 20-25 minutes in an oven set to 360F/180C. Let the dough cool on the baking tray. In the meantime, prepare the nougat. Heat up the pan from Step 7 over medium heat while stirring. The ingredients will start to produce tiny bubbles, which will gradually increase to medium-sized bubbles as shown. The bubbles should become larger and the mixture should become thicker. The color should also slightly become cream-like. Keep your eye on the pan. Continue stirring the mixture from Step 21 and continue to cook. It should become thicker and the cream color will become darker. Stir the mixture from Step 22 slightly faster with a spatula while simmering. It should become even thicker, meaning it is almost ready. Turn off the heat once the mixture resembles the mixture shown here. Be careful not to simmer too long or else it will caramelize to a hard texture. Add the walnuts and cranberries from Step 6 to the mixture from Step 24 and mix. Adding the cranberries and walnuts makes the color of the nougat appear darker, but ideally, it should be a light cream color, which is lighter than shown in Step 25. Evenly spread the nougat from Step 26 over the cookie dough from Step 19. Use a spatula to smooth the surface. The nougat will spread out while baking, so there's no need to be precise. This photo is an orthodox florentine made with the same amount of cookie dough, using nougat made with just 100 g of sliced almonds. Bake the nougat topped cookie dough from Step 27 for 25 minutes at 360F/180C. The baking time will depends on your oven, so keep your eye on it after baking for about 15 minutes. This is the florentine with sliced almonds from Step 28. Don't worry if the surface bubbles a bit after it is finished baking. It will harden naturally. If you bake it too long, the texture will not turn out, and the florentines will be hard to eat, so be careful. Slide the dough onto a cooling rack from the baking sheet, and let it cool. Once it is cool to the touch, cut it into desired sizes and they are done. The florentines from Step 28 will become harder and more difficult to cut as the dough cools. Don't forget to set an alarm to ring after 5 minutes. I cut the walnut florentines into 3 x 8 cm for a handy size to fit the plastic bags that I have, but you can cut them into any size you like. I don't like hard and sticky florentines. The combination of the crispy, light cookie and the crunchy nougat is so delicious, everybody will love them. I put each piece in a plastic bag with a package of silica gel, and sealed them with a sealer. I love both walnuts and cranberries or sliced almond. You can also mix them, of course. Have fun making your own version. I posted a delicious florentine-style tart. It isfor Florentine Amandines. Give it a try, too.",

The soup base is done. While the soup is still hot, transfer to heat-resistant bowls and top with the garlic bread ( see Step 7) and cheese. You can also use a lightly toasted baguette instead of garlic bread. Preheat the oven and bake at 180C for about 15 minutes or bake in the toaster oven for about 7 minutes. It's ready when the tops are browned. It's easier to bake in the toaster oven if you're just preparing 1 or 2 serving(s). Cut the garlic clove in half. Rub a 1 cm thick slice of baguette with the cut side of the garlic. Thinly spread butter and toast in a toaster oven. Make a large batch, and store the caramelized onions and garlic bread in the freezer for later use. (To defrost the toast, put it in the refrigerator overnight.) The reason for baking is to melt the cheese and brown the top; this could be done with either an oven or a toaster oven.

Adjust seasonings if necessary. If the bechamel sauce seems too thick, add 1/4 cup more milk; if its too runny, return to heat and add a tablespoon of butter and whisk in a tablespoon of flour. Set aside until ready to use. Preheat oven to 400 F. Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions. When done, drain off the water. Grease an 8x11 lasagna dish with butter. This should make a 3-4 layer lasagna so evenly use your ingredients according to how many layers you want to maek. Spread 1/4-cup of bechamel on the bottom of the dish. Layer 3 to 4 lasagna noodles on top of it. Spoon some meat sauce on top of the noodles then spoon some more bechamel sauce on top of meat. Sprinkle with a bit of Parmesan cheese and dot with butter. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients have been used up, ending with bechamel sauce for the top layer. Bake for 30 to 45 minutes, or until browned on top and bubbly.

        "For the crepe batter: In the bowl of a food processor, mix all of the crepe ingredients until smooth. Cover the batter with plastic wrap and refrigerate for an hour or up to 2 days. For the pastry cream: Heat milk, vanilla and salt in a saucepan over medium heat to bring the mixture just to a boil. Stir occasionally. Whisk in matcha powder as it heats. As the milk mixture is heating, whisk together egg and sugar in a medium sized bowl until the mixture becomes pale. Add cornstarch and flour, mix until smooth. Slowly add 1/3 of the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture, whisking continuously. Then pour the milk-egg mixture back into the saucepan. Cook over low heat and whisk continuously until the custard is thickened, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Pour the custard through a sieve and into a bowl to make it super smooth. Let it cool for 15 minutes. Put a sheet of plastic wrap right on top of the custard to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate until cold and set, at least 3 hours or up to 2 days. To prepare the crepes: Heat a 9-inch skillet over medium-high heat with a light coating of oil. Pour 1/4 cup of crepe batter into the skillet, swirling the skillet until it evenly coats the bottom. Let it cook undisturbed until the bottom is golden and the top is set, about a minute. Carefully flip it over and cook for 15 to 20 seconds on the other side. Transfer the crepe to a baking sheet to cool. Continue with the remaining batter. Its fine to stack the crepes to cool completely. To assemble the cake, lay the first crepe on the serving plate and spread with 1/4 cup pastry cream. Repeat this layering process with all the crepes and cream until you place the last crepe on top. Chill the cake in the fridge. Sprinkle with powdered sugar before serving.",

Heat the milk gently in a small saucepan, add the sugar, then take the pan off the heat, add the soured cream and stir through to combine. Leave to cool to body temperature. Meanwhile, put the flour, bicarbonate of soda, baking powder, cocoa and salt together in a large bowl. Once the milk mixture has cooled to body temperature, add the eggs, vanilla and oil to the pan and stir to just combine. Pour the liquid ingredients into the flour mixture and fold gently together. Transfer the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a large nozzle and pipe circles about 8cm (3in) in diameter on to the lined baking trays, spaced about 8cm (3in) apart. Bake in the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until a skewer inserted in the thickest part comes out clean. Leave the whoopie cakes to cool on the trays. Meanwhile, to make the buttercream, beat the butter, icing sugar and vanilla together in a bowl until light and fluffy, then beat in the milk. Once the whoopies are completely cool, gently release them from the baking paper. Take a generous dollop of the buttercream and spread it onto the flat base of one of the whoopies, then sandwich it together with a second whoopie. Repeat with the rest of the cakes.

        "Plump up the raisins in boiling water, drain and pat dry with paper towels. If the raisins are coated with oil, wash it off. Put all the ingredients except the ones marked in the bread machine, and start the dough-only program! Since there are a lot of dried fruits, add them to the dough when the 'mix-in' signal sounds (with about 45 minutes left in the program). When the 1st rising is done, test the dough with your finger. The finger test: press a moistened finger into the dough and pull it out slowly. If the hole made with the finger remains it's good! If the hole fills back in, it has to rise some more. Take the dough out onto a floured work surface, divide into 12 pieces (45-50 g each) and round off each piece. Cover with a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel, and rest for 10 minutes. Dust the dough lightly, turn over, deflate and round off with a smooth surface on top. Line up on a baking sheet in pairs, each pair of rolls touching each other. Cover with a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel, and leave to rise (2nd rising) at around 30C for 40 to 50 minutes (at room temperature if in the summer). If a moistened finger gently pressed in the dough leaves a mark, it's done rising. Mist with water, (optionally dust with bread flour) and preheat the oven to 200C. Lower the temperature to 180C and bake for 10 to 12 minutes - done! They look like this inside. I used this \"Super Fine Hard\" whole wheat flour. This version has 50% whole wheat flour (140 g finely ground) + 140 g bread flour. This really has the flavor of whole wheat, and the more you chew the better it tastes. This version has 64% whole wheat flour (160g superfine whole wheat + 20 g graham flour) + 100 g domestic bread flour. This version is very light! For the version in Step 11: Try baking six rolls stuck together, or slashing the tops. If you use domestic bread flour, use 170 ml of water. This version has 82% whole wheat flour (210 g superfine whole wheat flour + 20 g graham flour) + 50 g bread flour 30 g each of walnuts and raisins = densely textured and delicious.",

Strain into a squeeze bottle. May be refrigerated for 1 day; use at room temperature. Makes about 1 1/4 cup. For the sandwiches: combine the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and garlic and divide between two large bowls.

Place 8 slices of eggplant on a work surface and top each with a slice of tomato. Place a slice of goat cheese over the tomato and sprinkle with the basil (some basil will be left over). Cover with the remaining eggplant slices. Place the sandwiches on the grill just until the cheese has softened, about 1 minute, turning once (DH says he won't turn the sandwiches next time as it made them a bit messy).

In a large bowl cream together the butter and sugar with a mixer. I recently read somewhere that this is the one step that a lot of bakers skimp on but when done right, it makes a huge difference in the texture of the final product. So dont be afraid to be an overachiever like me and let your mixer go until the butter/sugar mixture is light and fluffy. Next, add the well beaten eggs and vanilla to the sugar and butter and mix well. Set aside. Combine the flour, salt and baking soda in a large bowl. Here is where I like to add my only departure to Mrs. Alexanders original recipelemon zest. If you want to, add it in with the flour mixture and mix to combine. Once you get your dry ingredients combined, add all of it into the creamed mixture in the mixing bowl along with the buttermilk. Mix on medium-low speed until just combined then add the mashed bananas. And I like to keep them a little chunky, but if you want to mash the tar out of them thats OK too. The last thing is to add the pecans (or walnuts) and gently mix them in. Put the batter into your prepared pans and then place the pans into the preheated oven. ** I usually make one 12-count pan of cupcakes and two small loaf pans. If youre using a large loaf pan, bake time is about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. I bake my cupcakes for right at 30 minutes and they come out perfectly golden-brown. Once theyre done, leave them in the pan for a minute and then set them on a wire rack to cool.",

        "The steps are the same as (the strawberry cheesecake version: https://cookpad.com/en/recipes/149903-baked-strawberry-cheesecake-bar ). Take the cream cheese and egg out of the refrigerator and bring to room temperature. Remove the cream filling from the Oreo cookies, place in a resealable bag and crush into a powder. 10 cookies make about 35 g of Oreo powder. Combine the crumbled Oreo from Step 2 and the melted butter. Line a pound cake mold with parchment paper, press the cookie-butter mixture on the bottom, and chill in the refrigerator. If you press down hard with a plastic-wrapped kamaboko board or some flat surface, the crust will be flattened properly even in the corners. Preheat the oven to 355F/180C. Beat the egg well. Mix cream cheese with a whisk. Add all the ingredients except one by one, mixing well between additions. Put the pound cake mold from Step 3 on a scale. Add 1/2 of the cheese mixture plus 10 g (about 115 g). Bake for 15 minutes at 355F/180C. There's no need to cover with foil. As the cake bakes, melt the white chocolate into the remaining cheese mixture in a double boiler. Sift in the matcha, add the condensed milk, and mix very well with a whisk. Take the cake out of the oven after 15 minutes and pour in the mixture from Step 8. Lower the heat to 340F/170C and bake for 25-30 minutes, covered with aluminium foil. It's done. Let it cool, cover it tightly and chill in the refrigerator (at least 6 hours). Cut into 4-6 pieces as you like, and it's done. I used 5 pieces of Kiri brand cream cheese. I doubled the amounts to make one 18 cm square mold. If you don't cover the top with foil, it browns like this.",

Grate the cooked potatoes into a large bowl using the largest holes on a box grater. Add the salt and egg and mix well. Add the flour slowly, only adding as much as you need so that the dough will not stick to your hands. Kneed the dough, as you would for bread, for 3 minutes on a lightly floured surface. Separate the dough into 6 smaller balls and roll out each ball into ropes about 3/4 inch thick. Cut each rope into 1 inch pieces. Ive never been able to get the hang of putting the little groves on the gnocchi with the tines of a fork, but you can look up the technique online if youd like to try it! Basically you just roll the 1 inch gnocchi pieces along the tines of a fork to imprint little groves. Cook in a pot of well-salted boiling water. Continue cooking for approximately one minute after they rise to the top. Four ways to serve the gnocchi: 1. Boil gnocchi and serve with a homemade tomato sauce. 2. Boil gnocchi and transfer to a saute pan and saute until golden brown adding homemade tomato sauce or sauteed veggies. 3. Mix cinnamon and nutmeg into the dough before boiling.

Place the dough on a working surface and knead very very shortly, just enough to bring the lumps together and form a thick roll. Wrap the roll in kitchen foil and refrigerate for 30 minutes. In the meantime, put the chicken and chicken stock in a saucepan. Bring stock to a boil and cook the chicken for 15 to 20 minutes or until cooked through and juices run clear. Take it out and let it cool down. Cut into small pieces. Chop the scallions into thin rings and the red pepper into small pieces. Preheat the oven to 200 C/400 F. Butter a spring form pan (26 cm/ 10 inches diameter) or 8x8 baking dish. Take the roll of dough out of the fridge and cut it lengthwise into enough thin slices to cover the bottom of the pan. Keep a few slices and use them to form a dough rim up the side of the tin. Press the dough with your fingers to close the cuts and spread the dough evenly. Alternate layering the chicken pieces, scallions and peppers into the tin. Sprinkle with the grated cheese. Beat the eggs in a bowl, add the milk and nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste. Pour the mixture into the spring form and bake in the hot oven for about 40 to 50 minutes until golden brown. Take the pie out of the oven and let stand for about 15 minutes.

Using a fork, toss the almonds with the sugar and butter until combined. Press the mixture into a 9-inch glass pie plate, making sure its evenly distributed up the sides of the pan. Bake crust for 12-14 minutes until fragrant. Let cool completely on a wire rack. 2. For the filling: Puree the strawberries and sugar until smooth. Set aside. 3. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F. In a large bowl, whisk together the 3 egg yolks and 1 whole egg until slightly thickened. Whisk in the condensed milk, then the lemon juice and zest. 4. In the bowl of a stand mixer or a medium clean bowl, beat the 3 egg whites until stiff peaks form. 5. Using a rubber spatula, fold 1/3 of the whites into the lemon mixture. Gently fold in the remaining whites. Pour the filling into the cooled crust. Drizzle the strawberry puree over the lemon filling, then lightly drag a thin knife through the filling to swirl colors together. 6. Bake pie for 13-15 minutes until barely set. Let pit cool completely on a wire rack. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator overnight before serving. Pie should keep, covered and refrigerated, for 2 days.

Roll each piece into a ball and place a chocolate piece in the center while shaping it. Place buns evenly on prepared baking sheets. Cover with oiled plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Using a piping bag with a small nozzle, pipe a cross on each bun. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. While still very hot, brush glaze over the buns. I did it twice. Transfer to a wire rack and let them cool. Eat them while still warm or at room temperature!",

Meanwhile, measure 3 cups flour into a large bowl. Using a fork, stir in 1/4 cup sugar and 2 tsp salt. Form a well in centre of mixture. Add eggs, oil and yeast mixture. Stir well, using a spoon, just until blended. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface. Knead dough with floured hands. When dough becomes sticky, liberally sprinkle flour on kneading surface. Continue kneading until dough forms a smooth satiny ball, about 10 minutes. By this time, you will have incorporated most of flour, and dough should bounce back when pressed with your finger. Place dough in a large oiled bowl. Roll around inside of bowl until dough is completely covered with a light coating of oil. Cover bowl with a piece of oiled waxed paper, topped by a damp cloth. Let stand in a warm place, such as on top of the refrigerator, until doubled in size, about 45 minutes. In the meantime, prepare filling. In a small bowl, blend ground almonds and sugar. Stir in egg white, milk and almond extract until thoroughly blended. Set aside. Punch down dough. Cover and let rise again until double in size, about 45 minutes. Divide dough into 3 equal parts. Roll into long strands. Flatten each strand with rolling pin. Spread almond filling over each strand to 1/4 inch from sides. Roll back into long strands. Place strands on a lightly greased baking sheet. And braid loosely. Tuck in ends. * Cover with a damp cloth and let dough rise until doubled in size, about 45 more minutes. Preheat oven to 400oF.

Serve over bed of hot, cooked rice. * I've also made this using frozen peppers and/or onions.

Mix 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese and the black pepper in with your spinach pesto, and then set aside. 3. Prep your chicken by cutting it in half horizontally and then cutting each half into quarters. Next, tenderize using the smooth side of a mallet. If you do this your should end up with chicken thats tender. See related blog post for photos of what 1 chicken breast will look like after its prepped. 4. After you have cut and tenderized your chicken, heat your skillet and 2 teaspoons of olive oil over medium-high heat for 2-3 minutes until the oil is nice and hot, but not smoking. Add your chicken to the pan and cook 3 minutes on the first side, and then flip and cook 2 minutes on the second side. By cooking your thin pieces of chicken on a medium high heat they will brown, cook through, and remain juicy on the inside. Once cooked, set your meat aside on a plate and cover with tin foil. 5. Add your onion to the skillet and cook over medium heat for 4 minutes, or until your onions are soft. While your onions are cooking, chop your artichoke hearts and sun-dried tomatoes. 6. Once your onions are soft, add your spinach pesto, artichoke hearts, and sun-dried tomatoes to the pan. Stir to combine and cook for about 5 minutes until everything is heated through. 7. Turn your heat to medium-low, add your chicken, and sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until the Parmesan begins to melt. 8.

        "Note: The recipe for the streusel topping and cream cheese filling makes enough for 3 dozen muffins so youll have extra for another recipe or triple the amount of the listed muffin ingredients to make a full three batches. For the muffins: 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 12 muffin tin with liners. 2. Combine the flour and baking powder in a bowl. Set aside. 3. In a large bowl, combine the pumpkin, oil, eggs, pie spice, sugar, baking soda, and salt until smooth. 4. Slowly whisk the flour mixture into the pumpkin mixture. Fill each muffin cup 1/2 full (I used an ice cream scoop). Then add 1/2 teaspoon of the cream cheese filling (see instructions below), and then cover that with some more batter so it is 3/4 full. Sprinkle streusel (see instructions below) over each muffin. 5. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the muffin comes out clean. 6. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes, then transfer the muffins from the pan to a rack and cool completely. For the streusel topping: Makes enough for 3 dozen muffins so youll have extra for another recipe or triple the amount of the listed muffin ingredients to make a full three batches. 1. In a small bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, nuts, pie spice (or cinnamon), and butter. 2. I use a tablespoon measure to distrubute the streusel onto each muffin. For the cream cheese filling: Makes enough for 3 dozen muffins so youll have extra for another recipe or triple the amount of the listed muffin ingredients to make a full three batches. 1. In a small bowl, combine the sugar, vanilla, spice/cinnamon, and cream cheese and mix until well combined and smooth. 2.

        "A note about peppers: Remember to use caution and always use gloves while handling. I always remove the seeds from mine before chopping but if you like hotter salsa feel free to leave them inches. A note about tomatoes: you do not have to peel them, but most people prefer doing so. To quickly and easily peel them: give them a quick rinse to wash them off. Then drop them into a pot of boiling water for about a minute or until you see them crack and peeling. Remove with a slotted spoon into a large bowl of very cold ice water. Now you can easily remove the peel and the core. I usually put the chopped tomatoes into my 2 quart pitcher to measure the tomatoes. To make salsa: Put all ingredients EXCEPT cornstarch and water into a large stock pot. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Boil over low heat for 10 minutes. Mix together the cornstarch and warm water in a small bowl. Make sure the mixture is very smooth- you dont want any corn starch chunks in your salsa. Add the corn starch liquid to the big pot of salsa, stirring while pouring. Boil on low for 10 minutes, watching carefully so that nothing sticks to the bottom of the pot. Pour into prepared canning jars, leaving about 1\" for head space.

        "Begin by chopping the raw bacon finely with a sharp knife. I slice it in half, then in strips, then dice it. The key is to make it small. I do not recommend a food processor because it heats the bacon up too much and can become gummy. Gently mix all ingredients in a large bowl and add the bacon. Form into 6-8 patties and put in the freezer for 30 minutes before grilling. This is not a necessary step, but I think the meat holds together nicely when the patties go on cold. Grill patties approximately 5 minutes on each side. Allow them to rest 5 minutes before serving. Top with cheese if you wish and any of your favorite toppings.",

Place the gelatin in a small bowl and add the warm water. Allow this to sit so that the gelatin gets dissolved. To prepare the meringue, create a double boiler using a saucepan and bowl that will set securely over the pan. Fill saucepan half way with water and bring to boil over medium heat. Combine egg whites, salt, and sugar in the bowl which will become the top portion of the double boiler . Mix the eggs, salt and sugar a bit until mixed. Place the egg whites onto the bottom of the boiler or saucepan with water. Whisk the egg whites until light, fluffy and foamy and the sugar is fully dissolved. Fold in the dissolved gelatin from step 2. Remove the bowl from the heat and whisk with an electric mixer (using the proper attachment if you have it). Whip the egg mixture until the eggs are cooled, using the sides of the bowl as your gauge. Be careful not to overmix or the eggs mixed with the gelatin will coagulate. Quickly pour the yogurt into the eggs in a stream, folding the two mixtures together. Again, if you fold too slowly the mix will begin to thicken too early.

(Fresh salad cream will only last for about 3 to 4 days in the fridge, so its pointless making a huge batch. ). Boil the eggs for about 10 minutes then place in ice cold water to cool. Once cooled remove the shells and slice in half, place the yolks in a bowl and wrap the whites in cling film and place in the fridge, you can do something else with them. To the egg yolks add a teaspoon of English or Dijon mustard, a pinch of salt and pepper, and a splash of vinegar. You can also add a sqeeze of lemon juice too if you want. Blend all these together to form a thick paste. Now start to add some cream, do it slowly and keep mixing. You dont want the sauce too thick or too runny. When you think its nearly at the right consistency, stop and do a taste test. Now is the time to add more mustard or pepper if your taste buds demand it. Finish off by adding a little more vinegar until you acheive the right consistency. Of course if you dont want to add more vinegar add a little more cream, as I said earlier this is a flexible recipe so make it how you like it. Store in a clean jam jar in the fridge for up to 3/4 days. Use in sandwiches, salads, dips, dressings etc.",

In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, melted butter, 3 tablespoons of the milk and vanilla. Using an electric mixer set on medium, beat the egg whites until frothy. Add the cream of tartar and beat until thick, fluffy and white but before peaks form. Add 1/4 cup of sugar, a little at a time, and continue beating until the whites are glossy and firm peaks form when the beaters are lifted. Whisk half the flour mixture into the yolks (it will seem like paste). Whisk a quarter of the egg whites into the yolk mixture to lighten it. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in another quarter of the whites. Sift half of the remaining flour mixture over the batter and fold in. Fold in another quarter of the egg whites followed by the rest of the sifted flour and finally the rest of the whites. Scrape batter into the pan and smooth the top with the spatula. Bake until the cake is golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Let cool. Meanwhile in a blender or food processor, puree the mango with 2 to 3 tablespoons sugar, or to taste depending upon how sweet your mango is. When the cake is cool, use a fork to poke holes all over the top, then cut the cake into 18 pieces, but dont take the pieces out of the pan. In a small saucepan over medium heat stir together the coconut milk, condensed milk, remaining 1/3 cup milk, brandy and a pinch of salt. Heat until steaming, then pour it evenly over the cake. Cover and chill the cake for at least 1 hour or overnight. Just before serving, whip the cream with the cinnamon and half of the pureed mango until thick and mousse-like. Taste and add more sugar if it tastes flat. Spread the mango cream on the cake, then dollop on the remaining mango puree. Use a spatula to swirl the mango puree into a marble-like pattern.

Wrap the garlic cloves (with skin on) in tin foil and bake for 20 minutes. When done, remove the packet from the oven and allow to cool. When cool enough to handle, remove garlic skin and finely chop the cloves. Turn off the oven. If you have a food processor, first use a knife to chop the zucchini into quarters. Put the quarters into the food processor and pulse 8 to 10 times or until shredded but not mushy. Put the zucchini into a colander. Then shred the leek in the food processor and add it into the colander. If you dont have a food processor, use a box shredder or similar to shred the zucchini and finely chop the leek. Set the colander full of zucchini and leek shreds with a bowl underneath it. Sprinkle salt over the shreds, toss with your hands and place the colander and bowl in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. This allows the water to seep out of the squash (and into the bowl). Preheat oven to 375 F and prepare a lightly oiled baking sheet or line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Transfer the shredded zucchini and leek to a large mixing bowl. In a small bowl, beat the egg. Pour beaten egg over zucchini/leek. Add cheese and flour and stir to incorporate. Form patties out of the mixture and place on the baking sheet. Bake for 12 minutes then remove them from the oven, carefully flip the fritters and bake another 12 to 15 minutes until edges are crispy and the fritters feel dry when poked.

Remove from heat and remove lemon slices. Add the lemon juice and set aside to cool. Make the filling: Pour milk into a large saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium heat. When the milk comes to a boil, whisk in the semolina, sugar, eggs, lemon juice and lemon peel, stirring constantly. Cook, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens and comes to a full boil. Remove from heat, and set aside. Preheat your oven to 350 F. Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish, and layer 6 sheets of phyllo into the pan, brushing each one with melted butter as you lay it in. Pour the semolina custard into the pan over the phyllo, and cover with the remaining 6 sheets of phyllo, brushing each sheet with butter as you lay it down. With a very sharp knife, cut into serving-sized pieces, cutting all the way through to the bottom. The phyllo and custard filling are delicate so cut with care and with a really sharp knife. Bake for 40 minutes, until the top crust is crisp and golden brown and the custard filling has set. Remove from the oven and pour the cooled syrup evenly over the top. Make sure you also pour around the edges. Allow Galaktoboureko to cool and absorb the syrup (around 4 hours). Serve warm or cold. A scoop of vanilla ice cream goes really well with this too, especially when served slightly warmed! Refrigerate leftovers.",

Also, I used a mandoline to slice my carrots relatively thin. 1. Bring a pot of water to boil and cook the udon noodles or linguine according to the package instructions. Drain, rinse with cool water and set aside. 2. Prepare the sauce by whisking together the fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar, Sriracha Chili Sauce and water. 3. Heat one tablespoon of canola oil in the wok or saute pan on medium-high heat. Add in the diced garlic to flavor the oil for a minute or so. Add the chicken thighs and season with ground black pepper. Cook for approximately 7 minutes, stirring after 4 minutes or so to cook on all sides. Cook until the chicken is just cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside on a separate plate. 4. Add the remaining one tablespoon of canola oil to the wok or pan. Then add the broccoli florets and the sauce mixture. Scrape the bottom of the pan to loosen anything that may be sticking. Stir the broccoli to coat with sauce and cover the wok or pan with the lid to steam. Keep covered for 5-7 minutes and cook unitl the broccoli is crisp-tender. If you need to add a bit more water to steam it, go ahead, but only a tablespoon at a time. Uncover to stir after about three minutes. 5. Uncover and add the chicken, carrots and green onions to the broccoli. Cook for another 5 minutes or so until the broccoli and carrots are cooked to desired tenderness. Be careful not to overcook. 6.

Rub the butter into the flour with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Next add approximately 1/2 of the egg yolk and the water. Mix well your hands. Try to work quickly. Wrap the dough and chill for 10 -15 minutes. Now take the dough and roll out into a large square that is about 18 inch thick, using a rolling pin. . Cut it into 5x3 inch rectangles (you should get about 15) using a pastry cutter or sharp knife. I made some little boat or leaf shaped moulds out of cardboard, covered with aluminum foil. Or you can use similar store bought molds (need to be a bit smaller than 5x3 inch size, to fit your dough rectangles). Grease moulds. Put the pastry rectangles into the greased moulds (use butter or coking spray) and make sure the dough goes up the sides as well. Then trim off the excess pastry. Prick the base with a fork to prevent air bubbles. Make the filling: In a pan heat 1/2 table spoon olive oil over medium high heat, add garlic and mix until slightly softened. Next add onion and salmon. Mix until onion is softened and everything is heated through. Add pepper and salt. Mix well. Place your prepared filling in the pastry boats and beat the egg. Brush the egg over the top of the filling. Bake about 20 minutes at 200C degrees or until the crust is golden brown. Remove from oven and let cool. After that decorate with colored mashed potatoes. Take a potato. Peel and boil it, covered with water, until potatoes are fork tender. Drain the water. Squash the potato with a potato masher or mixer. Add butter salt, white pepper and food coloring. Mix well. Put mashed potato mixture into a piping bag and pipe it on top of the filling, as Ive done in the photo above. The sails were made out of carrot (cut into rounds and stood up on top of the potato filling). See picture.

        "Begin by preheating your oven to 400 F. Poke the top of each potato with a fork in two or three places and place on a baking sheet. Bake potatoes in the oven for 1 hour. Once potatoes are cooked, remove the pan from the oven and place potatoes on a plate to let them cool for about 15 minutes. Once your potatoes are cooled, use a sharp bread knife and you will each potato cut lengthwise into thirds, making 3 long slices. So each potato will yield two skins and one center piece, right? Discard the middle slice or reuse for breakfast the following morning. Or heck for that matter, add some butter, salt and cream, and make some rustic mashed potatoes. Continue this cutting process with the rest of the potatoes. You should then have 10 skins when done. With a small spoon, being careful, scoop out about 70 percent of the potato flesh. Make sure that you keep some of the potato attached to the skin so that it is sturdy. Next, melt your butter in the microwave for 30 to 60 seconds. Get your broiler heated to high. Brush the butter on the inside and outside of each potato skin and place them back onto the baking sheet. Season the inside of each skin with salt and pepper. Place them under the broiler for 8-10 minutes or until the insides get a bit crispy from the melted butter. Remove them from the oven and fill each skin with a bit of ground beef and shredded cheese. Place the pan back in the oven and cook another couple of minutes until the cheese is nice and melted. Remove the sheet from the oven once again, and fill the skins up with shredded lettuce, tomato, black olives and avocado. Crumble nacho chips over the top of each one and drizzle the warmed cheese all over the top. Again, place them back in the oven and cook until the cheese is nice and melted. Remove them from the oven, sprinkle with a bit of salt and plate them up. Take a picture. Just kidding. Dig in. Each bite is filled with awesome nacho-ness. Is nacho-ness even a word? Seriously, make these. If you are a fan of nachos, you are going to be a huge fan of these nacho potato skins.",

Grill the fish until it shows brown grill marks, the fish is opaque, and the flesh flakes easily, 6 to 8 minutes per side. Serve grilled salmon with fruit skewers.",

Quinoa is done when the seeds have sprouted. Remove from heat and set aside. Heat a large pot of water to boiling and add the broccoli. Cook just long enough to take the raw taste out and until broccoli is bright green. This will take about 90 seconds. Drain broccoli and rinse with cold water to stop broccoli from continuing to cook. Set aside. To make the broccoli pesto, puree 2 cups of the cooked broccoli, the whole cloves of garlic, 13 cup of the almonds, 1/3 cup of the Parmesan, salt and lemon juice in a food processor. Drizzle in the olive oil and heavy cream and pulse until nearly smooth. Just before serving, toss the quinoa and remaining cooked broccoli florets with the broccoli pesto. Taste and you might decide to add more lemon juice or salt at this time. Add the remaining 13 cup Parmesan cheese and taste. Add more if you like. Spoon mixture onto a serving platter or plates. Add toppings of your choice. I highly recommend some sliced avocado and liberal amounts of the red chili oil. For the red chili oil: Heat 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil in a small saucepan until heated, but not so hot that it smokes. Turn off the heat and stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes. Set aside and let the oil cool. This is good prepared the day before and kept in the refrigerator overnight. Bring back to room temperature again before using. Recipe adapted from 101 Cookbooks.",

Add some Benefibe or your choice of fibre powder, and honey; the honey I used was \"raw\" or unprocessed honey straight from a local apiarist/bee keeper, and is not runny like shop bought liquid honey and has a nicer, less syrupy flavour, almost creamy in nature. Blend again very well, ensuring the honey has fully dispersed through the mix. As there is banana involved, the smoothie will start going slighty darker, or brownish if not consumed right away, so is best if you only make what you are going to drink immediately, or it wont look as appetising later.

        "This is one of my favorite recipes! And it is really easy to make. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Dump the cake mix in a bowl. If it is lumpy, sift the cake mix. I promise it is worth it. You dont want to bite down on a lump of dry cake mix. (Believe me, Ive done it before.) Add in the entire can of pumpkin. Keep mixing together until completely combined and smooth. Dough should look like a thicker, softer ball of pumpkin. Add semi-sweet chocolate chips. (Or if youre like me, add 1 1/2 cup.) Mix until combined. Grease a cookie sheet. Spoon cookie dough onto the cookie sheet. I use large tablespoons because I like large cookies. Yup, theyll look all rough and scraggily, but they taste good! Bake for 15 to 17 minutes. Youll know they are done when you touch them and they bounce back a little bit. Let cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes, then transfer to waxed paper, tin foil, or the counter. Dont put them on a cooling rack. They are too soft for that and they will fall right through. Mmmm. Enjoy! Eat with milk, if you like that sort of thing. They definitely are rich enough! But a lady at the store told me that they are actually low-fat because you use pumpkin instead of oil and eggs. I dont really care either waythey are delicious! (And EASY!) Here is the recipe doubled: * 2 boxes Spice Cake Mix (you can also use carrot cake) * 1 29 oz can pumpkin * 1 bag or 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips Combine all ingredients. Bake at 350 degrees for 15 to 17 minutes. Makes 70 large cookies or 96 small cookies.",

        "See related blog post for photos of the entire process. Most people know how to fry bacon. I am one of those people now. I was NOT one of those people five years ago. In fact, I completely embarrassed myself trying to fry bacon in front of a former employee. I was a nanny for a guy who was a chef for the Library of Congress. ...not just a lowly line cook, mind you....he was a full on chef. (They paid me $30,000+ a year to watch their kiddo, so he was making quite a tidy sum Im guessing...) Anyway, I was cooking lunch for his 3 year old and he happened to be home. I decided to make BLTs. I didnt know that you shouldnt fry bacon on HIGH heat. So I burned the bacon and filled the house with smoke...SO embarrassing... I eventually learned how to fry bacon correctly. It starts with a pan on MEDIUM to maybe medium-high heat. Lay out the bacon closely, but not touching (or they will become friends, bond together and be hard to flip). See how those strips in the back are starting to bubble just a bit? That is good. Here go a few more... When they start browning on the bottom they are almost ready to flip. Flip the strips one by one with a fork and fry the other side. As soon they have some froth on top, light brown all over and shriveled up a bit, pull it off quickly and get it onto a plate lined with paper towels (to catch the grease). If you are being more precise, you could have several plates to line the bacon up on to dry so that it doesnt clump together, but I didnt need to be precise with this recipe. After you finish pulling the bacon out of the pan, make sure you turn the burners off! I let the grease sit in the pan until cool, then slide it off with a spatula and save it for things like sliding grease under the skin of a turkey or making a pot of beans taste delicious. The grease will freeze too and also makes good suet bakes with birdseed during winter. Do not use bacon fat suet in the summer because it might rot and/or attract meat eaters.",

Continue to simmer until the alcohol flavor cooks out, about 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove and discard the bay leaf. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. Remove from the heat and keep warm. Poach the eggs in a pot of simmering, salted water in which a little vinegar has been added (vinegar makes the egg whites constrict quickly).

Add ingredients in batches if your food processor is small. Pulse until finely chopped. Spoon the Recaito into an airtight container and store covered in the refrigerator. Keeps for about three to five days. Storage: Freezes well. Put Recaito in small freezer Ziplock bags and freeze. When ready to use, there is no need to thaw. Just add about 2 tablespoons of Recaito (more or less to your preference) to oil in a pan and saute for about 10-15 minutes on low heat, mixing occasionally.

        "Place 1/4 cup raisins in a small bowl and just cover with hot water, set aside to soak. Prepare vegetables Peel and finely chop 2 cloves of garlic. Wash, core, seed and finely chop bell peppers. Grate carrots. Chop onions. In a frying pan (a wok or some other dome shaped pan is best for this recipe, we want to try to cook it quickly and preserve as much of the liquid that will come out of the veggies as possible). Pour 1 to 2 Tablespoons of oil in the pan and add garlic. Slowly warm the garlic on low heat in the oil until it begins to sizzle. Turn up the flame to medium/high heat and brown the ground meat seasoning it with salt and pepper (not too much here, lots of other flavor is coming). Once meat is brown throw in all the vegetables and stir fry until the onions and bell peppers are tender. Add bouillon cubes and raisins (with the water they were soaking in). If at this point most of the water from the vegetables has evaporated you might want to add another 1/4 to 1/2 cup of water to help dissolve the bouillon cubes. Once bouillon cubes have dissolved add curry powder and worcestershire sauce. Stir well and lower flame. Allow this to simmer for about 10~15 minutes stirring occasionally. Test the flavor and adjust to your liking. For more savory, add a bit more worcestershire sauce, more spicy add more curry, more sweet maybe? Whip out a little ketchup. Turn up the flame to high again and stir well until most of the liquid is gone. Enjoy on a bed of sticky rice, with your favorite Indian naan bread or other bread! This is a very flexible recipe. Add any of your favorite veggies, like mushrooms, zucchini, squash, spinach, tomatoes, etc. Add a couple of cans of cut tomato before you start simmering and this could even be a surprise curry sloppy joe!!! This freezes beautifully and is even more delicious the second or third day if kept in the fridge. So make a bunch, youll thank yourself!! !",

In the bowl of a stand mixer combine the milk and yeast and let rest 10 minutes until foamy. In a medium bowl whisk together flour, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, cardamom, brown sugar and salt; set aside. In a medium bowl, combine eggs, melted butter and pumpkin puree. After the yeast and milk have rested for 10 minutes, add the pumpkin puree mixture into it and mix with the stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment until combined. Add 1/2 of the dry ingredients and mix on low until combined, about 30 seconds. Add the remaining dry ingredients and mix on low speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Remove the paddle attachment and fit the stand mixer with the dough hook. Mix with the dough hook on medium-low until smooth and somewhat sticky, about 3-5 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and place in the warm oven. Let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour. After the dough has doubled in size, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for 10 minutes. Then shape into rolls or a braided loaf. To make a braided loaf: Lightly grease a large baking sheet and set aside. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface. Divide dough into 2 pieces, one roughly half the size of the other. (Small piece will weigh about 9 ounces, larger piece about 18 ounces.) Divide the large piece into 3 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 16-inch-long rope, about 1 inch in diameter. Line up ropes of dough side by side and pinch ends together. Braid the free ends together, pinching the braid closed at the other end and tuck both ends under braid. Place braid on baking sheet. Divide smaller piece of dough into 3 equal pieces. Roll each piece into 16-inch-long rope, about 1/2 inch in diameter. Braid together, pinching ends to seal. Brush some of egg wash on top of large loaf and place small braid on top of the larger braid. To make dinner rolls, lightly grease a 9x13 inch square baking pan. Divide into 18 balls (about 3 ounces each). To shape, take a piece of dough and start forming a round, smooth ball by pulling the sides to the center and pinching to seal. Place, pinched side down, on a counter. Lightly cupping your hand around the dough ball, rotate your hand in small circles lightly rolling the ball around the palm of your hand and place in prepared baking pan. After your dough is shaped, cover it loosely, and let it rise for another 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the top of the bread lightly with the egg wash. Bake until golden brown and an instant read thermometer inserted in center reads 190 degrees F, roughly 30-35 minutes. Remove the bread from the oven and allow to cool on a rack.",

        "Preheat oven to 300 F. For the graham cracker crust: In a medium sized bowl, combine graham wafer crumbs, melted butter, and sugar. Stir until well combined. Press graham crumb mixture into the bottom of a 9 springform pan. Set aside. For the pumpkin cheesecake filling: In the bowl of a stand mixer using the paddle attachment, cream together the cream cheese and sugar. Add eggs, one at a time, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Add pumpkin puree, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg. Continue to beat mixture for several minutes (4 to 5) on medium speed to incorporate some air into the batter. Add cornstarch and beat for an additional 3 to 4 minutes. Pour filling over graham crumb base. Bake at 300 F for 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes (depending on your oven) or until center of cheesecake is slightly jiggly. Cheesecake will continue to bake slightly once removed from the oven. Remove from oven and set pan on a wire rack to cool. Once cooled to room temperature, refrigerate cheesecake for several hours or overnight. The cheesecake can also be frozen at this point by leaving it in the springform pan and tightly wrapping the pan with plastic wrap. For the caramel sauce: In a small saucepan over medium high heat, melt the butter. Then add the brown sugar and stir continuously with a rubber spatula until the brown sugar is melted and you can no longer feel the sugar crystals with your spatula on the bottom of the pan. Add whipping cream and mix well. Continue to boil, without stirring, for 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Drizzle caramel sauce over sliced cheesecake. Garnish with whipped cream. If your caramel becomes too thick as it cools, you can reheat it in the microwave for 20 seconds, or place the pan back on the stove on low heat to rewarm.",

Let the beans cool, then peel the outer skin from each of them; discard skins, set favas aside. Peel and cut potatoes into 1/2-inch pieces; cut the fennel bulb into 1/2-inch pieces (you can save the fronds for another recipe, or use them as garnish). Place potato and fennel pieces into a deep pot and cover with cold water; bring water to a boil and simmer for 20 minutes or until tender. Add the shucked/blanched/peeled favas and cook for another 5 minutes. Drain well, then pass everything through a food mill - do not use an electric mixer to combine the mixture - a food mill will give the best texture for this dish. Over medium low temperature, heat together the half and half and butter until the butter is melted.

        "Make the meringue: Heat oven to 250 degrees. Butter the inside of a 2-quart souffle mold or baking dish, at least 3 and 1/2 inches deep, then use 2 tablespoons sugar to coat butter, knocking out excess over the sink. Using an electric mixer set on medium-slow speed, beat egg whites until they begin to froth. Add salt and cream of tartar, increase speed to fast, and continue to beat until whites hold soft peaks. Add remaining sugar a tablespoon at a time and beat until whites hold stiff peaks. Beat in vanilla. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in almond flour. Spoon mixture into the prepared dish and smooth the top. It might overfill the dish; thats O.K. Do not press mixture down. Bake until meringue has risen at least 1/2 inch and is very lightly colored on top, 30 to 40 minutes. Let cool at room temperature for 30 minutes, then refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 1 day. Prepare the creme Anglaise: In a medium, heavy saucepan, bring milk to a simmer. In a bowl, vigorously whisk together yolks, sugar and salt until pale yellow and thick. Whisking constantly, dribble in about half of the hot milk. (Dont stop whisking or you risk curdling the eggs.) Pour yolk mixture into the pan with the rest of the milk and gently cook over low heat, stirring constantly and thoroughly, especially around the sides of the pan. When mixture starts to thicken enough to coat the spoon, about 5 minutes, add apricots and cook for 2 minutes longer, just enough to soften the fruit, while continuing to stir. Transfer apricot mixture to a food processor or blender, add vanilla and puree until just smooth. Dont overdo it: you dont want a mousse-like froth. Chill until serving, at least 1 hour and up to 3 days. Run a knife around the sides of the meringue to loosen it from the dish and unmold it onto a large platter or, even better, into a wide, shallow bowl. The sugar syrup thats formed will run down the sides of the meringue. Pour apricot creme Anglaise around the island, creating a pale orange sea. Serve garnished with sliced almond and apricots, if you like.",

        "Preheat the oven to 200 C/400 F. Line a 12x15 inch/39x30 cm baking tray with baking paper. Separate the eggs and put the whites in one bowl and the yolks in another. Beat the egg whites with the pinch of salt until quite stiff. Gradually add half of the granulated sugar and beat until glossy and stiff. Set aside. In another bowl whisk together the egg yolks and remaining half of the sugar until foamy. Mix together the flour and cornstarch and sift it over the egg yolk-sugar mixture. Add 1/3 of the egg whites and incorporate. Add the remaining egg whites and fold in gently. Spread the mixture onto the prepared baking tray and bake for 8 to 10 minutes until golden brown. In the meantime place a clean kitchen towel on the table and generously sprinkle it with icing sugar. Take the cake out of oven and place it directly onto the kitchen towel with the baking paper facing up. Carefully remove the baking paper then immediately roll up the cake (starting from a short side and helping yourself with the towel). Leave the cake roll to get completely cold (it wont take too long, about 1 hour). Soak the gelatin leaves according to the packets instructions. Mix the lime juice and a few pinches of the grated zest (you can place the rest of the grated zest on a small piece of paper, let it get dry and then use in other recipes) with the icing sugar in a small pan. Heat the mixture gently, without letting it boil. Remove from heat. Squeeze the gelatin leaves gently, place them in the pan with the juice and stir until it dissolves. Set aside for a couple of minutes. In a food processor, puree the basil leaves together with the quark and the lime-gelatin mixture. Place everything in a bowl and refrigerate for 30 minutes. In the meantime chop the strawberries into very small pieces and set aside. Beat the heavy cream until stiff. When the quark-lime mixture starts to set, gently fold in the whipped heavy cream. Roll out the cake roll. Spread the quark mixture evenly across the top, leaving a bit of space around the edges. Sprinkle the chopped strawberries all over it and roll the cake carefully again. Place on a serving tray with the seam facing down and refrigerate for at least 2-3 hours until the cream sets completely. It might happen that you will have some extra filling left like I did. Dont try to force all of it in the roll, it will just come out around the edges. Place the leftovers in a small bowl and enjoy instead of dessert. For decorating the roll, whip another cup of heavy cream with a little icing sugar and spread it all over the roll. Slice some strawberries and arrange on top of the roll. You can also sprinkle the roll with some almond slices or coconut flakes. Note: Instead of using another cup of heavy cream to decorate the roll, you can save the calories and just sprinkle the roll with icing sugar and arrange some strawberries on top or around the roll.",

        "The sushi rice: Cook the rice, mix with sushi vinegar while it's still hot and set aside to let cool. Prepare the additional ingredients: Either grill or microwave a piece of salted salmon to cook it through. You can put it in the rice cooker and cook it along with the rice and take it out when both are done if you like. Mix the eggs and milk together, and make finely scrambled eggs (iri tamago) using just a little oil. You can cook it in a nonstick frying pan without any oil instead. Using two different sized molds or bowls or cups etc. for the cake, pack with the scrambled eggs sushi rice nori seaweed sushi rice cooked flaked salmon sushi rice, in that order. Invert the two packed molds to form two layers. Place the smaller \"cake\" on the very edge of the bigger \"cake\". Decorate: Slice the daikon radish thinly, sprinkle with salt and massage it in to tenderize it. Cut a slice for the cake message and leave it to soak for a while in sushi vinegar. Cut the smoked salmon into 5 to 6 cm pieces. Layer and roll them up into rose shapes. Spread out the outer 'petals' to make them look extra-voluminous. Roll the thinly sliced and salted daikon radish to make rosebuds. If the daikon radish is too thick or not squeezed out tightly enough it will be hard to roll! Microwave the snow peas, slice in half diagonally and use as \"leaves\" around the roses. Make the mashed potatoes. Cook potatoes in the microwave and mash them up. Add salt, mayonnaise, milk, and a tiny bit of butter, and pass the mixture through a sieve. After passing the mashed potato mixture through a sieve, add some milk so that it's the consistency of cream. Put the potato-cream in a piping bag fitted with an icing tip and decorate the cake with it. Make the \"lace\" for the cake. Slice the lotus root thinly, cook in the microwave and sprinkle with salt. Put the slices around the cake. Cut the quail egg face parts out of nori seaweed using scissors or a nori punch (used for bentos). Cut letters out for the daikon radish plaque. If you moisten the surface of the eggs and daikon radish slightly it's easier to stick on the nori. *Add color to the quail egg faces with a little red food coloring dissolved in water or ketchup, using the tip of a toothpick. *I scattered on some salmon caviar too, but I forgot to take a photo of it. *Use a clear glass plate or a plate that's not white under the sushi cake.

To make Rub: Combine 3-4 Tablespoons Seasoning and 3-5 Tablespoons Coconut rum until the mixture has a loose paste like mixture but can still stick to your wings. You may need more rum depending on your preferences ;). Get your grill hot and ready for your wings. Lay the wings out on the grill evenly spaced and not touching each other, if your grill isn't big enough for all 30 wings. Cook them in two batches. Since the cooking time is different for each grill, in the first fifteen minutes check for the heat of your grill and how your wings are responding to the heat and whether you'll need to adjust the heat or not. Flip wings after 15 minutes and apply rub to the wings sparingly, the jerk seasoning is very hot in spice. Let wings cook for another 15 minutes and flip and apply rub sparingly.

Beat egg whites in a bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high speed until whites are foamy, then add cream of tartar and salt. Continue beating until whites hold soft peaks. Add 1/2 cup superfine sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating, then increase mixer speed to high and continue to beat until whites hold stiff, glossy peaks, about 5 minutes. Fold in remaining 1/2 cup superfine sugar gently but thoroughly. With back of a spoon, spread meringue into 10 (4-inch) rounds, 5 on each lined baking sheet. Form a 3-inch-wide depression in center of each round (shape and smooth exterior side of each round with a butter knife if desired). Using a fine-mesh sieve, lightly dust confectioners sugar evenly over meringues. Bake, with oven door propped open about 1/2 inch with handle of a wooden spoon, until meringue is crisp, about 2 1/2 hours. Turn oven off and let meringues stand in oven, with door propped open, until dry, at least 1 hour. Carefully peel off parchment. Whisk together flour, cornstarch, a pinch of salt, and 2 tablespoons granulated sugar in a small bowl. Whisk together yolks in a medium bowl, then whisk in flour mixture until smooth. Bring milk just to a boil with remaining 2 tablespoons sugar in a 1 1/2- to 2-quart heavy saucepan, stirring until sugar is dissolved.

        "Heat the heavy cream in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan until bubbles begin to form around the edge of the pan. Make sure that you have chopped the chocolate as finely as possible to allow it to melt quickly and easily. Place the chopped chocolate in a medium-size mixing bowl. Make a ganache by pouring about half of the hot cream over the chocolate and letting it sit for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. Then slowly whisk until smooth and homogenous. Do not add all of the hot cream to the cold chocolate at once; the shock of the temperature extremes would cause the fat in the chocolate to separate. As the chocolate melts, you will see some elasticity if there is no fat separation. This means the chocolate still has an emulsion; the fat molecules are still holding together. If the ganache separates, it loses its elasticity, collapses, and becomes very liquid. I use a hand-held immersion blender to ensure a smooth ganache and to keep the emulsion of the chocolate. Add the remaining cream gradually and mix until all of the hot cream is incorporated and the ganache is smooth and homogenous. If the ganache separates, it is very easy to fix. Simply add a small amount of cold cream and whisk well. This will bring the ganache back together. The ganache should be thick, shiny, and smooth. Add the desired flavoring and mix until fully incorporated. Pour the ganache onto a plastic wrap-covered baking sheet and spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Cover the ganache with plastic wrap and allow it to cool for at least 4 hours at room temperature. I usually make the ganache at the end of the day and let it cool overnight. As it cools, it will thicken and set. When the ganache has cooled to the consistency of toothpaste, scrape it into a pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tip. Do not stir the ganache when you do this. Incorporating air by stirring will cause the ganache to harden. Pipe 1-inch-diameter mounds spaced 1 inch apart on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. To pipe the mounds, hold the pastry bag at a slight angle and allow the tip to touch the parchment as you begin to pipe. Once you have formed the mound, stop squeezing and lift the tip straight up, leaving a small tail on the top of each mound. You can also use a spoon and drop small mounds of ganache onto the baking sheet. Let the truffles harden at room temperature for a couple of hours (or in the refrigerator for 15 minutes), until they are hard enough to roll with your hands. When I roll the truffles, I usually wear surgical gloves. The gloves are not mandatory but if you do not use them, be sure your hands are very clean. To roll the mound into a ball, place a truffle between both palms, squeeze slightly, and roll between your hands. The truffles will look nicer if they are as round as possible. When all the truffles are rolled into balls, they are ready to be coated. If they have become too soft, place them in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours until they are firm enough to dip. You can use either a dipping fork or your hands to dip the truffles in chocolate. To use the fork, drop the truffle into the bowl of tempered chocolate and then retrieve it with the dipping fork. Hold the fork over the bowl for several seconds to allow the excess chocolate to drip back into the bowl. Gently scrape the bottom of the fork against the side of the bowl to remove any excess chocolate and roll the dipped truffle in the desired garnish. Place on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. If you use your hands, dab some chocolate in the palm of one hand. Roll the truffle in that palm to completely coat it with chocolate. Place the enrobed truffle on the baking sheet. Repeat for the remaining truffles. This method is very quick but it can also be extremely messy. When all of the truffles have been coated once, repeat the enrobing procedure. This is necessary only when you enrobe the truffles by hand rather than with a fork. The truffles are usually more evenly coated when dipped with a fork. As soon as each truffle gets a second coating, immediately roll it in the desired garnish. You need to do this before the chocolate sets or the topping will not adhere. At this stage, it is good to have a friend help because it is hard to dip and roll at the same time. Place the truffles on a clean parchment paper-covered baking sheet and allow them to set, about 5 minutes. The truffles will keep for up to 2 weeks at room temperature, when stored in an airtight container. To toast coconut: Preheat the oven to 400F (204C). Spread the coconut on a baking sheet and place in the oven for about 3 minutes. Remove from the oven and stir to keep the sugar in the coconut from burning. Return to the oven and toast until golden brown, about 3 more minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and cool on a wire rack. To toast nuts: Preheat oven to 300F (148C). Spread the nuts evenly on a baking sheet and place in the oven. Toast for about 30 minutes, until they are golden brown. You will be able to smell the nuts when they are ready. A good test is to break a nut in half and check to see if it is light brown on the inside. Toasting nuts brings out their natural flavor. Remove them from the oven and allow to cool completely on the baking sheet on a wire rack.",

Using an electric mixer, cream butter, vanilla and sugar in a large bowl until pale. Add eggs 2 at a time beating well after each addition. Sift the flour and baking powder together into the same bowl. Add in sprinkles and chocolate chips and gently fold mixture until just combined. Pour half of the mixture into each cake tin and bake for 40-45 or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out mostly clean. When cooked, allow cakes to cool in tins for five minutes before turning out onto wire racks to cool completely. When cakes are at room temperature, slice the top off both so that they have a flat surface and set the tops aside. Out of one cake cut out an oval (for the body) and a banana-shape for the tail. Reserve remaining cake. Out of the second cake cut out a piece for the head connected to the neck (small oval for head and curved shape for neck- I followed the curve along the outside of the cake for the neck) and 4 small rectangles for the legs. Reserve remaining cake. Out of leftover cake cut-offs, cut out six small triangles for the spikes along the dinosaurs back. Assemble the pieces together on a cake board or desired serving platter to get the rough shape of your dinosaur, shaping and sizing where necessary until you're satisfied with the shape. Remember you can perfect the shape with icing. Dust off any crumbs and set dinosaur aside. To make the icing beat the butter with an electric mixer until white and creamy. Add icing sugar 1/2 a cup at a time and beat well. Add in milk and beat for a further 1-2 minutes. Lastly, stir in enough food coloring to achieve your desired colour. To ice the cake, start by spreading icing on the tops of each spike that goes along the dinosaurs back. Pour some sprinkles in a shallow bowl so that you cant see the bottom of the bowl. Press the iced top of each spike onto the sprinkles carefully so that it is covered in sprinkles. Return spikes to their position on the dinosaur and continue icing the cake. Spread and even, smooth layer of icing all over the cake using dobs of icing to connect each section of the cake if necessary. When cake is completely covered in every nook and cranny and icing is used up you are ready to decorate. Place 3 mini m&ms on each foot of the dinosaur to create toes. Place the mini marshmallows on the head for eyes and dot the black writing icing on each marshmallow to make pupils. Draw a smile on the face of the dinosaur using the red writing icing. Lastly place the smarties on the dinosaurs back and neck for spots. Chill cake for at least 1 hour or until icing is set and ENJOY!",

Brush skillet with more butter and make 3 more crepes in same manner, stacking crepes on plate.

Remove from heat and let rice stand, covered, 10 minutes. While rice is standing, stir together vinegar and remaining teaspoon soy sauce. Transfer rice to a wide nonmetal bowl (preferably wood, ceramic, or glass) and sprinkle with vinegar mixture, tossing gently with a large spoon to combine. Cool rice, tossing occasionally, about 15 minutes. Stir together wasabi and remaining teaspoon water to form a stiff paste. Let stand at least 15 minutes (to allow flavors to develop). Place sushi mat on a work surface with slats running crosswise. Arrange 1 sheet nori, shiny side down, on mat, lining up a long edge of sheet with edge of mat nearest you. Using damp fingers, gently press half of rice (about 3/4 cup) onto nori in 1 layer, leaving a 1 3/4-inch border on side farthest from you. Arrange half of cucumber in an even strip horizontally across rice, starting 1 inch from side nearest you. (You may need to cut pieces to fit from side to side.) Arrange half of carrot just above cucumber in same manner. Peel avocado half and cut lengthwise into thin slices, then arrange half of slices just above carrot in same manner. Repeat with radish sprouts, letting some sprout tops extend beyond edge. Beginning with edge nearest you, lift mat up with your thumbs, holding filling in place with your fingers, and fold mat over filling so that upper and lower edges of rice meet, then squeeze gently but firmly along length of roll, tugging edge of mat farthest from you to tighten. (Nori border will still be flat on mat.) Open mat and roll log forward to seal with nori border. (Moisture from rice will seal roll.) Transfer roll, seam side down, to a cutting board. Make second log in same manner, then cut each log crosswise into 6 pieces with a wet thin-bladed knife. Serve with wasabi paste, soy sauce, and ginger.",

        "Directions for frosting and The Pioneer Womans Homemade Caramel Sauce at the end of this recipe. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Grease two 8-inch x 2-inch round cake pans with butter. Line the bottom of the pans with parchment paper, then butter and flour the pans. Set pans aside. Sift the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into the bowl of an electric mixer, and mix on low speed until combined. Set aside. In another bowl, combine the buttermilk, oil, eggs, and vanilla. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry. With mixer still on low, add the coffee and stir just until combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake for 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool in the pans for 30 minutes, then turn them out onto a cooling rack and cool completely. Place one of the cakes, flat side up, on a flat plate or cake pedestal. With a knife or offset spatula, spread the top with frosting (recipe below). Scatter some of the Snickers pieces over the icing, then drizzle a little caramel sauce over it (recipe below). Place the second cake layer on top, rounded side up, and spread the frosting evenly on the top and sides of the cake. Press two rows of Snickers pieces into the sides of the bottom edge of the cake, all around the cake. Decorate the top of cake with remaining Snickers pieces. Drizzle caramel sauce over the cake as desired. The Pioneer Womans Homemade Caramel Sauce: Mix the brown sugar, half-and-half, butter and salt in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook while whisking gently for 5 to 7 minutes, until it gets thicker. Add the vanilla and cook another minute to thicken further. Turn off the heat, cool slightly and pour the sauce into a jar. Refrigerate until cold. For the frosting: In the bowl of an electric mixer, use the mixer to combine the cream cheese, butter and vanilla until smooth. Slowly add the powdered sugar and beat until combined. I like to put my frosting in the fridge to firm up a bit before frosting my cake.",

Mix well and check dough consistency to determine how much of the remaining flour you should add. (I generally use 9 cups of flour every time. ). Knead dough for 8 to 10 minutes (or less, if using an electric dough mixer). Place dough in a greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. You can refrigerate the dough overnight or leave out and let it rise until the dough nearly doubles in size. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and divide in 4 equal parts. Roll each section into a 12 to 14 inch circle. Brush circle with melted butter and cut (using a pizza cutter) into 12 pie-shaped pieces. Roll the slices, starting from the wide end to the small pointed end. Place rolls, small end down, on a greased baking sheet.

        "To roast the garlic, cut the top quarter of the bulb off and discard. (It is the pointy side you want to cut off.) Drizzle about a 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil over the bulb then wrap in foil. Place the wrapped bulb directly on the oven rack. Bake at 450 degrees F for about 40 minutes or until the garlic is very tender. Remove from the oven, unwrap and allow to cool. When cooled, squeeze the garlic cloves from the papery skin and mash. To make the dough, mix all the ingredient together except the flour. Add the flour a little at a time and knead or mix until a soft dough forms. Press onto a prepared pizza pan. To build the pizza, spread the dough with your favorite pizza sauce. Then add the chopped artichokes and sliced black olives. Top with mozzarella cheese, roasted garlic (you have to kind of spread it on or crumble it the best you can with your fingers) and sun dried tomatoes. Bake at 475 degrees for 12-15 minutes or until crust is golden brown and cheese is melted. While the pizza is baking, prepare the garlic butter. In a skillet, melt the butter and add the minced garlic. Cook until the garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the parsley, cheeses and chicken and allow to melt together. It may look like a gloppy mess, but thats what you want. Keep it warm and stir often while the pizza cooks. When the pizza is finished cooking, remove it from the heat and put the garlic butter/cheese mixture on top of the pizza. Serve hot. Makes 2 thin crust pizzas or 1 thick crust pizza.",

The more water you have in , the faster the yokan will cool, but if you use too much non-heated water the ingredients might set while you're still working. Put all the ingredients in a pan and start heating. When it's bubbling, simmer for about 2 minutes, then turn off the heat. You have to simmer it or the kanten won't set. Next, put the entire contents of the can of adzuki beans in a blender. It won't blend well on its own, so add some of the water little by little, and process. Reserve some of the water. By processing the beans at this point until they're smooth, the yokan will have a silky texture. Add the well pureed beans to the the pan with the kanten liquid. Add the remaining water to the blender, rinse out the bean puree sticking to the sides and pour into the pan. This was the reason for reserving some of the water. All the ingredients are in the pan now. They will now be poured into the mold. When the mixture has cooled down enough to refrigerate, put it in the refrigerator to chill and set completely.

        "1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Using cooking spray, coat a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Set the tart pan on a baking sheet. 2. To make the crust: In a medium-sized bowl with a flat and level bottom, mix graham cracker crumbs and sugar together by hand with a fork. Pour melted butter over crumbs and mix until thoroughly moistened. Empty crust mixture from the bowl into the tart pan. Using the bottom of the mixing bowl, firmly pack the crust down evenly over the bottom of the tart pan, allowing for the excess crumbs to push out toward the edge of the pan. Then, use your fingers to form and pack down the crust up the sides of the tart pan. Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake the crust for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven when done, leaving the tart pan on the baking sheet and allow the crust to cool. 3. To make the cheesecake filling (while crust is baking): In an electric stand mixer with a wire whisk attachment, beat cream cheese on high speed until smooth. Stop the mixer as needed to scrape the sides of the bowl. Decrease the mixer speed to slow and add the sugar and the flour, mixing until combined. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing until combined. Finally, pour in lemon juice, vanilla, and almond extract and mix until combined. Fill the prepared crust to the top edge with filling. 4. Bake for 3035 minutes until the center is set and appears dull. Now remove the tart pan from the baking sheet and allow to cool. When completely cool, place in the refrigerator and allow to chill for at least 5 hours but ideally overnight. 5. To arrange the fruit topping: When closer to serving time (12 hours), decorate the top of the tart with fruit as desired. Then brush fruit with melted preserves. Keep cool until ready to cut and serve. Refrigerate any leftovers. Note: Other fruits can be used. I have used pineapple, kiwi, peaches, mango, grapes. With lighter colored fruit, I then use a lighter colored fruit preserve like peach. (Recipe adapted from Cooking Club. June/July 2010)",

I like my cookies a deep true holly green. But you can decide how green you want your cookies. Stir well, this takes a minute! Now, carefully and slowly add the corn flakes and gently stir to cover them in the green mixture. Reduce the heat just enough so that the mixture stays warm but you dont cook the flakes. You will have to stir this occasionally. I keep a small cup with water on the stove to keep spoons wet to make things easier. Drop small spoonfuls of the mixture onto the wax-paper-covered cookie sheets and have a helper drop 3 Red Hots onto the cookie right away. You can do it but it will take a lot longer to make them. Wet the spoons briefly in your cup of water, and get some more mix and repeat dropping spoonfuls onto wax paper and Red Hots. You will end up with 48-60 cookies. When finished, dump the hot water into the pan with marshmallow mix and that makes clean up a dream! Store in an airtight container.

[Kneading] In a large bowl, place the flour and make a well in the center. Add sugar and yeast into the well. Place salt at the edge so it is away from the sugar. Pour 35C lukewarm water aiming into the center, mix until the dough comes together. When the dough comes together, move it to a working surface. Knead for 5-10 minutes. Rub the oil into the dough, add ingredients and knead more. Make the dough into a ball, cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out. Allow it to rise. Dust some flour onto an index finger and poke the center of the dough. If the hole stays as it is, the rising is complete. If the dough bounces back, it is not quite done yet. Let it rest a little longer. After rising, punch down to let the trapped air out, divide the dough into 6 parts and reshape them into balls. Let it rest for 15 minutes. Reshape the dough into balls one more time. Be careful not to let the dough dry up. Allow it to rise again. When the dough becomes 1.5 times bigger than the original size, the dough is done rising. Start preheating the oven to 250C, to be ready at the right time. Dust some flour on top of the dough and make a slit. Drip some olive oil into the slit, spray a small amount of water, and move onto Step 11 (the dusting flour and the olive oil is not included in the recipe). Reduce the oven temperature from 250 to 230C. Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature again to 200C and bake for another 5 minutes. When the top becomes your desired color, it is done. When you are using a bread machine, regular temperature water can be used during the summer time or when the room temperature is high. (It is ideal to preheat the oven to the highest temperature.)

In a large pan, heat the olive oil to medium heat. This is usually when I add the garlic powder. I add quite a bit but its really up to your taste. 2. Once the olive oil has reached the proper temperature, add the chickpeas and saute until the chickpeas turn golden and crusty, usually about 8-10 minutes. 3.

Pulse almonds with 1 1/3 cups confectioners sugar in a food processor until very finely ground (mixture will resemble sand), 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and sift in remaining 2 cups confectioners sugar, then stir until combined well. Beat egg whites with salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed until they just hold soft peaks. Add granulated sugar a little at a time, beating, then increase speed to high and continue to beat until whites hold stiff, glossy peaks, about 3 minutes. Stir whites into almond mixture until completely incorporated (batter will be thick), then divide batter evenly among traced circles on baking sheets (about 1 2/3 cups per circle), smoothing into 1/2-inch-thick rounds.Let rounds stand, uncovered, at room temperature until tops are no longer sticky and a light crust forms, about 30 minutes. Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 300F. Bake macaroon layers, switching position of baking sheets halfway through cooking, until macaroons are crisp and edges are just barely pale golden, about 25 minutes. Turn off oven and let macaroons stand in oven 10 minutes. Cool completely on baking sheets on racks, about 1 hour. Simmer dried apricots in water in a 2- to 3-quart heavy saucepan, uncovered, over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until apricots are very soft and most of liquid is evaporated, about 15 minutes. Stir in preserves, then cool completely. Heat almonds in a 12-inch dry heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until almonds are hot but not yet colored, about 2 minutes. Add confectioners sugar and continue cooking, stirring and tossing, until almonds are lightly toasted and sugar glaze is caramelized, about 3 minutes. Immediately transfer almonds to a large sheet of foil and spread into 1 layer with a fork. Cool completely. Just before serving, beat together mascarpone, heavy cream, and Amaretto with cleaned beaters at medium speed until thick and smooth, about 2 minutes.

        "[Tart crust] This is my way of making tart crust, but you can feel free to use your preferred recipe. First, allow the butter to soften to room temperature. Add the sugar to the softened butter and mix until well blended. Then mix in the egg yolk. Add the milk and blend thoroughly. Sift the flour and add along with the almond powder, mixing with a rubber spatula. After the flour is integrated into the dough, gather it into a ball to rest in the refrigerator. Even if the crust becomes crumbly press it together with your hands. Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it chill for at least an hour. [Topping] While your crust is resting, saute the apples. Melt butter in a frying pan and place thinly sliced apples in a single layer. Once the apples are cooked to transparency, allow them to brown slightly and then cool. Butter the tart pan. Preheat the oven to 180C. Roll the crust you prepared to about 5 millimetres and place in the pan. Pierce several times with a fork and bake for 15 minutes. [Almond cream] While the crust is baking, prepare the almond cream filling. Mix the softened butter and sugar until well blended. Add the eggs beaten in several batches, mixing well after each addition. Add the almond flour and pour into the baked tart shell. Arrange the cooled apple slices on top of the tart and bake at 170C for 30 minutes. Remove the tart from the pan after it has cooled and let chill. In a small pan mix the sugar and water and heat over a medium flame. Once it comes to a simmer, shake the the pot occasionally and allow it to brown. Once it becomes a caramel colour, immediately take it off the heat. Pour this over your finished tart and you're finished! It'll add a crispy layer and make it even more delicious, but it's fine to omit if you're short on time or ingredients. I made a small tart with the leftover crust and topped it with a raw apple. The crunchy apple was also delicious.",

        "For the cupcakes: 1. Preheat the oven to 350 F/177 C. 2. Combine water and 1/2 cup of the sugar and bring to a boil in a saucepan over medium heat. When it hits a boil remove from the heat, add chocolate and stir until the chocolate is completely melted. Stir in the butter until melted. Let the mixture cool for about 10 minutes. 3. Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl using a whisk attachment, whip the eggs, the remaining sugar, and vanilla extract until is has reached maximum volume. This process should take about 10 minutes. 4. Gently fold the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture. 5. Line cupcake tins with paper liners and fill each cupcake liner 2/3 full. I use 1 cupcake pan that fits 12 and 1 cupcake pan that fits 6. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Remove pans from the oven and set on a rack. Let cupcakes cool a bit. Then pop them in the freezer for 15 minutes, just so that they are easier to work with. 6. Cut cupcakes in half horizontally. Put the top half of the cupcake upside down on the plate with the bottom half beside it. Stack in this order: whipped cream, chopped strawberries, second half of cupcake, whipped cream, and then a quarter of a strawberry on top. Serve immediately.",

        "Preheat oven to 400F. Prepare chicken wings by using poultry shears and sniping off the wing tips (discard, or freeze for other use, like stock), and snip at remaining wing joint. This gives you \"2\" wings per wing. Spread oil on baking sheet. Spread wings in single layer on baking sheet. You may choose to slide wings around on the oiled sheet, to put a light coating of oil on the wings. Less oil on wings makes for slightly less crispness.a bit of oil helps seasoning stick. You could omit oil, and spray with a good quality non-stick olive oil product. This step is optional. Sprinkle as liberally as you dare with your choice of seasoning. This is where experimentation comes in, be daring, try what's in your spice cabinet, however I've come to like a common \"All Island Soul Seasoning\", with a touch of cayanne or ground red or white pepper. If you're cutting back on salt, be cautious of prepared seasoning, as they have a lot of sodium. Bake until browned, cooked through, and a bit crispy. About 40 minutes. Use your nose and eyes to check! I use my convection setting on my oven too, which cuts on the cooking time, but makes a nice crisp even coating. Remove from oven, and cool for about 15 minutes. Melt butter and mix with hot sauce. (again. amount of hot sauce to your taste). Toss with the wings in a serving bowl with the butter/hot sauce mixture. Serve with your favorite Blue Cheese Dressing and celery sticks.",

        "First, make the marinade for the chicken: Combine olive oil, lime juice, chipotle peppers, garlic, cumin, salt, and pepper in a blender and mix until its totally pureed. Pour into a large ziploc bag with the chicken breasts. Seal the bag, smush it around to coat the chicken, and place it in the fridge to marinate for at least 4 hours (overnight if possible.) ***Note: You can use any marinade, homemade or storebought, youd like! Anything works. After the chicken has marinated, roast the chiles by using metal tongs to hold the peppers one by one over the flame of your stovetop until the skin is totally charred. (If you dont have a gas stove, you can use an outdoor grill OR place them on a baking sheet directly under your ovens broilers.) When the skin is totally blackened, place the chiles in a large ziploc and seal the bag to allow the chiles to sweat for a good 20 minutes. Remove them from the bag and use a knife to scrape off most of the blackened skin. Slice the chiles in half lengthwise, and scrape out the seeds and membranes. Lay out the roasted, seeded chile halves so theyll be ready. Grill the chicken (or saute it in a skillet) over medium-high heat for 4 minutes on the first side. Turn the chicken over, and on the cooked side lay on 2 chile halves and a nice slice of cheese. Turn the heat to medium-low and allow the chicken to finish cooking for 4 to 5 minutes, until its totally done in the center. The cheese should melt on its own; if it needs a little help, invert an iron skillet over it (or put the lid on the skillet, if using). Remove the chicken from the skillet and serve it with rice and beans on the side. Top the chicken with a spoonful of pico de gallo or salsa.",

Feel free to vary it according to your own tastes. If you can find black salt (at an Indian market) sub out half the regular salt for 1/2 of the black salt. Amchoor (dried mango powder) can be found in Indian markets or well stocked supermarkets and bulk stores. Grind any whole spices in a pestle mortar or spice grinder (aka coffee grinder).

In a large Dutch oven over medium high heat, warm half of the oil. Add the beef and brown well dont crowd the pan. I did this in three batches. Dont worry about the bottom of the pot turning dark brown thats flavor! Add more oil as needed. Once all the beef is browned, remove it from the pot and set aside. 3. Add mushrooms, onions, carrots, celery, and garlic to the pot. Add more oil if necessary to saute until lightly browned. 4. Return the beef cubes to the pot and add the wine. Bring to a simmer, and scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. This releases and dissolves all those browned bits. Yummy! Add sun dried tomatoes, chopped tomatoes, thyme, sage, potatoes and stock. Bring to a low boil, cover, and reduce the heat to simmer for about an hour. Add the zucchini chunks for the last 20 minutes of cooking. 5. Use a slotted spoon to remove the beef and veggie chunks to a bowl. Return the sauce that is left in the pot to medium high heat and boil until reduced and thick (the consistency of gravy). This should take 10 to 15 minutes. 6. Adjust seasonings (salt and pepper) for the sauce, then return the reserved vegetables and meat chunks back to the pot. Heat until bubbling. Stir in the parsley and basil just before serving. 7.

It needs to be thick enough to not run off your cookies Ice the cookies all over and place sugar balls at each star point before the icing sets too hard Start stacking them with the largest stars at the bottom and finishing with the smallest on top. Twist every alternate star so you get a good effect. You could colour the top star yellow and stick it upright in the icing of the previous star This makes an effective Christmas tree cookie stack for use as table decorations at Christmas dinner and your guests can have a nibble between courses!",

You should have about 3/4 cup of tomato pulp and juice; set aside. Place the shrimp in a medium bowl, add 1/4 teaspoon of the paprika, and season with salt and pepper. Toss to combine and refrigerate. Place the chicken in a medium bowl and season generously with salt and pepper; set aside. Heat an outdoor grill to high (about 450 degrees F to 550 degrees F). Place a 15-inch paella pan on the grill, cover, and heat until hot, about 2 minutes. Add the chorizo to the pan, close the grill, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sausage is starting to brown and the fat is rendered, about 2 to 3 minutes. Using tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer the chorizo to a large bowl; set aside. There should be a thin layer of rendered fat in the pan. If theres not enough, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the seasoned chicken to the pan in a single layer, close the grill, and sear, stirring occasionally, until both sides of the chicken pieces are golden brown, about 6 minutes total. (You will need to rotate the pan occasionally on the grill to evenly distribute the heat.) Using tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken to the bowl with the chorizo; set aside. Add the onion to the pan, season with salt and pepper, close the grill, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes, adjusting the heat as needed on a gas grill or moving the paella pan to a cooler part of a charcoal grill so that the onions dont burn. Add the garlic, remaining 3/4 teaspoon paprika, and saffron, stir to combine, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the reserved tomato pulp and juice and cook until the mixture has slightly darkened in color, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan, about 3 minutes. Add the rice and measured salt and stir to coat in the tomato mixture. Add the broth and stir to combine. Arrange the rice mixture in an even layer. Distribute the reserved chorizo and chicken over the rice, adding any accumulated juices from the bowl. (Do not stir the rice from this point on.) Close the grill and bring the mixture to a lively simmer. Continue to simmer, checking occasionally, until the rice grains have swelled, most of the liquid has been absorbed, and the rice begins to make a crackling sound, about 12 minutes. (Make sure to rotate the pan occasionally to evenly distribute the heat, and adjust the heat as needed to maintain a lively simmer.) Arrange the reserved shrimp and the shellfish (hinge-side down) in the rice, nestling them slightly. Close the grill and cook until the shellfish have opened, the shrimp are just cooked through, and the rice is tender but still al dente, about 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the pan from the grill, cover with foil, and let stand for 5 minutes. Before serving the paella, discard any unopened shellfish and sprinkle the dish with the parsley. Serve with the lemon wedges.",

Cut the tea bags open with clean scissors and empty out the contents! It's a bother to do this, but the powdered tea doesn't go bad that quickly, so I turned 3 bags into powder at once. I used this Magic Blender! Use this type of blender. A Bamix handheld blender is fine too! I think you can also use a food mill. Set the blender up properly! Blender for 11 seconds, and rest for 11 seconds. Repeat this 7 times. The tea leaves turn into this fine light powder! Transfer to a jar, and add a desiccant if you have one. (3 tea bags produce about this much.) Why does this produce 20 times the amount of tea? Because you only need about this much of the powdered tea per cup! Just use a tiny amount as shown, using the tip of a spoon. A closeup! You just need this much! This is a green tea cup so you may need a bit more for a big mug, but you really just need a tiny bit. Just add hot water and mix well. In the summertime, just add cold water! In wintertime just add hot water! The tea is ready in no time, and takes no effort! ! For teas with big leaves like oolong or some black teas, increase the processing cycles as needed. With just a little effort you'll have something that's sooo convenient!

Start by mixing the Jell-O with the boiling water until completely dissolved. Next, add the COLD watermelon juice. Put Jell-O in the fridge for about 1 hour, or until soft set (not runny! ). While the Jell-O is setting up, place the graham crackers in your blender and make crumbs. Then in a medium bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter with a fork until the butter is evenly distributed. Gently press half of the graham cracker crumb mixture into the bottom of a 9x13 pan. When the Jell-O is set, whip the mixture with a hand mixer. Add the whipped topping and mix well. Then gently fold in the blueberries. Spoon the Jell-O mixture onto the graham cracker crust. Smooth the top, then spoon the remaining graham cracker crumb mixture over the top, spreading evenly. Place the pie in the fridge to set for about 4 hours. Remove immediately before serving. Keep refrigerated. This freezerbox pie recipe is quite versatile. You can use any flavor Jell-O with most any fruit combination and the results will still turn out delicious! Try with your favorite flavor and fruit, and let me know how it turned out!",

Using a sharp knife, cut the breasts in half lengthwise, but do not cut all the way through. You want to cut almost through so you can fold it out into one big piece thats half the original thickness (you are basically butterflying it). With a rolling pin or a flat surfaced meat hammer, pound the breast out to about 1/4 inch thick. (Note: Try to keep all the meat close to the same thickness for even cooking.) Combine the meat with the marinade and store in the refrigerator for about 8 hours or overnight. After the meat is marinated, lay it out on a work surface. Combine the chopped fruit and pistachios and coat the top surface of the flattened chicken breasts with the mixture. Roll up the breasts and secure them closed with toothpicks. (Note: if you use too much stuffing, they wont roll up as well.) Prepare your smoker and bring the smoker temperature up to 250 degrees F. Once the temperature regulates, place the stuffed chicken breasts on the smoker. This should take approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes to cook to a tender perfection. Note: The internal temperature of the meat should be about 165 degrees F to be done. But it is very difficult to get accurate readings with the thinner meat and the stuffing involved.

Knead to make a soft dough that isn't sticky, adding more whole wheat flour in 1/4 cup increments as necessary. Knead for 8 to 10 minutes in a mixer. The dough should be very smooth and elastic and bounce back at you when gently pressed with a finger. Place the dough into a large bowl that has been coated with vegetable spray, cover with a clean and damp kitchen towel or a plastic wrap, and let double in volume. Coat two large baking sheet with cooking spray. Punch down. Divide the dough into half. Work with one at a time. Divide the dough into 12 equal portions. Roll each portion into a round. Place on one baking sheet coated with cooking spray, leaving about 1inch between each roll. Repeat with the remaining dough. Makes about 24 rolls. Let double again. Preheat the oven to 400F (200C). Brush the top of each roll with the egg white glaze. Sprinkle the tops of the rolls with the optional sesame seeds. Place on the middle rack of the oven. Bake 15 -20 minutes until crisp and the bottoms sound hollow when tapped. Cool on a wire rack. This bread freezes for about 3 months if tightly wrapped and kept airtight. Note: Regular yeast can be substituted if the Rapid Rise is unavailable. Please allow for a longer rising time when using the regular yeast.

Add the remaining giblets to the neck in the water and cook for a further 1/2 hour. Drain giblets; reserving liquid. Chop up the giblets into small pieces. Cover tightly and set aside (if using immediately) or refrigerate until ready to use in the recipe (can be done the day before). While the giblets are cooking the rest of instructions follow:. Preheat the oven to 350F degrees. Slice the bread into 1/2 inch cubes. Place the cubed bread onto a ungreased dry cookie sheet and toss with the dried herbs and spices. Bake seasoned bread cubes in the oven turning frequently (approximately every 5 minutes) until golden brown and crisp, about 20 minutes or so depending on how moist your bread cubes are. While the bread cubes are in the oven, saute the celery, onion and garlic in the butter until tender. Remove bread cubes from oven, leave to cool until crisp. Mix he celery, onion, garlic mixture into the cooled dried bread cubes. Mixing thoroughly. Add chopped giblets to the mix. Add the beaten eggs to the mixture, again mixing thoroughly. Mix reserved liquid from the giblets and combine with chicken broth to make 1 cup. Carefully add the chicken broth to your desired consistency. (Remember, if you are stuffing the bird it will take on more moisture so be careful how moist you want your stuffing at this stage). Stuff your bird, making sure not to pack it in to tightly and don't forget to pack a little in the neck cavity. Put the remainer of the stuffing into a generously buttered casserole dish and bake for 1/2 hour at 350F (covered with foil for moist stuffing and uncovered if you want a crispy top).",

Add garlic, and all chopped veggies (and pear) to frying pan, mixing occasionally. Cook until veggies are soft (~5-6 minutes). Once qunoa is done add it to the frying pan and veggies. Add the teriyaki (or soy) sauce (and butter if desired); season to taste. Garnish with a sprig of parsley or chives and serve (can be served hot or cold; I prefer hot). Enjoy!",

        "They are the things you need to make tofu. I use plastic containers made by Ziploc. I poked small holes in them and cut the lids smaller than the openings of containers so they could fit inside. Cut a cheese cloth or muslin into long strips big enough to cover the bottom and sides of the containers. You need 4. You can use a sieve and a handkerchief if you want. Note: I make 2 blocks of thin tofu. If you want to make a thick one, use one container and 2 pieces of cloth. Mix the nigari and water. Moisten the cloths and line the containers tightly, overlapping 2 cloths crosswise. Warm the soy milk in a pan to 170F/75C. If you don't have a thermometer, just bring to the boil and continue to warm for 3 to 5 minutes. When you put your finger in the heated milk, it'll be very hot and you'll want to pull out your finger immediately. This is around 170F/75C. Divide the nigari into 3 portions and drizzle into the pot gradually. Stir very gently and constantly, like you're moving the mixture towards the middle of the pan. Note: Do not add the nigari in one go. Add it little by little. Stir gently or it will not set. In this photo, it might be hard to see but the mixture has started to separate. You will have translucent liquid and softly-set tofu. If the mixture doesn't separate, add more nigari or increase the heat a little. Note: Too much nigari and heat will result in hard tofu. When the separation is finished, ladle the set tofu with a slotted spoon into the prepared container. If you divide the tofu into two, you will thinner tofu with a thickness of 2 cm. If you want to have thicker tofu, just use one container. Cover the tofu with the excess cloths hanging over the sides of containers. Cover with the lid and put a weight over the tofu. I used beer cans in this photo. You can use a glass of water instead. Leave to stand for 10 to 15 minutes, adjusting the weight and time to obtain the firmness of tofu that is to your liking. 15 minutes is how I like mine. Remove the weight and peel off the cloth to check the firmness. Or you can taste with a little bit of tofu. Cover a big bowl with water and place the tofu set in containers. Remove the containers in water. Remove the cloths from the tofu and soak in water for a while to remove bitterness of nigari. Handle with care because it is fragile. This is the tofu that you'll end up with! It doesn't look perfect, but it's still just as tasty as anything you can get in Japanese grocery stores. If you use colanders instead of plastic containers, you will have zaru (colander) tofu. I made chilled tofu (Hiya-yakko). Weigh it down with a can of beer for 15 minutes, and you will have very soft-set tofu. If you use this soft tofu for cooking, it might be too hard to handle.",

        "Prepare the tomato salsa using. Can be made ahead and stored in the fridge. Prepare the coriander cream sauce, using. Can be made ahead and stored in the fridge. Prepare the marinating ingredients. Remove any excess fat from the chicken thighs, but leave the skin on. Make some cuts in the thicker parts of the meat and spread to even the thickness. Place the chicken thighs in a dish, skin-side down, and put the marinating ingredients on top. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes to 3 hours. Start cooking the white rice or Mexican rice. Take the chicken out of the fridge about 30 minutes before you plan to cook it, and let sit at room temperature. Lightly pat dry the chicken with paper towels, sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper and dredge with flour. (This traps the flavor inside.) Heat up a frying pan with olive oil over high heat. Put the chicken thighs from Step 7 in the frying pan, skin-side down, and cook for 4 minutes. Wipe off any excess fat that comes out of the skin with a paper towel. (This makes the skin crisp.) Lower the heat to medium and cook for 8 more minures. (Keep an eye on it, and adjust the heat if it looks like it's getting too brown.) Heat up the Coriander Cream Sauce mentioned in Step 2 in a pot or in the microwave. When it looks like this photo, and 80% of the meat has turned white, it's time to flip it over. Turn it over and cook it for 4 minutes. If it's no longer pink on the inside when cut with a knife, it's ready. Dish up some Mexican rice on a plate, and place the chicken, skin-side up, on top. Spoon some of the coriander sauce and salsa on top of the chicken and garnish with coriander leaves. Put some coriander sauce and salsa in small dishes and serve them on the side. Note #1: The chicken is also good just fried, coated with salt & pepper and your favorite herbs or spices, without the two sauces. Note #2: Tomato-flavored Mexican rice, instead of green rice, also goes well with this.",

        "Soak beans overnight in a pot covered with an inch or two of water. The next day, heat the pot of beans until they are almost ready to boil. Meanwhile, prepare a big bowl of ice cold water, which you'll be throwing the beans in next. This will \"shock\" them and help crack the skin so they become softer easily when boiling. Drain off the hot water from the beans. Immediately throw them into the ice water. Drain beans and put back in pot. Pour in enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, then simmer on low for about 60 minutes until soft. Skim off any foam that rises while simmering. If the water gets low, add a little more. Once the beans are soft (they should be easily mashable), mix in the sugar. I used about 100g/half cup. But I recommend starting with less and adding a little at a time until it's sweet enough for you. Bring to a simmer again, making sure the sugar is dissolved. If it's too soupy, simmer off some of the liquid. That's it! You can optionally pour off some of the water and mash into a paste (called anko). Store it for up to week in the refrigerator, or freeze it along with the liquid. There are lots of ways to use and turn sweet azuki into yummy Japanese goodies: -eat over rice dumplings (dango )or ice cream -use paste as spread for bread or baked inside sweet buns -Made into \"zenzai\" soup along with \"mochi\" (rice cakes).

Zest the oranges, getting just the bright orange outer layer, none of the white pith. Each will yield about 1 tablespoon of zest. Place the cranberries in a medium saucepan. Add the water, sugar, and orange zest and stir to combine. Place on high heat, bring to a boil, and cook on high heat for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and cook another 5 minutes. While the cranberries are cooking, peel the oranges removing as much of the white pith layer as possible without getting all OCD and making yourself crazy. Separate the orange segments and cut them into thirds. You want big, juicy orange bites in the finished compote! Set them aside. Remove from the cranberry mixture from the heat when done cooking and add orange gelatin. Stir to dissolve. Stir in the canned pineapple along with its juice. Allow to cool (don't refrigerate) for 30 minutes. Stir in the oranges and walnuts. Stir well to evenly distribute everything. When completely cooled, spoon into containers, cover and refrigerate. I like to make the day before I want it so it's very well chilled when served. If serving this as a dessert, it's extra yummy topped with a big squirt of whipped cream and a maraschino cherry!

        "Begin by preheating your oven to 400 F. Poke the top of each potato with a fork and place on a baking sheet. Cook in the oven for 1 hour. Once cooked, remove from the baking sheet, and place on a plate to let them cool for about 15 minutes. Once your potatoes are cooled, use a sharp bread knife and cut lengthwise, into three segments for each potato. So you are making three long slices. Each potato will yield two skins, right? Discard the middle slice or use it for breakfast the following morning. Or heck for that matter, add some butter, salt, and cream, and make some rustic mashed potatoes. So in the end you will have 12 potato skins plus that middle section that you are going to use for something else! Set the skins aside. Make the blue cheese sauce. Now this sauce makes quiet a bit, so if you do not want to make this much, feel free to cut the recipe in half. Otherwise, make it and use it as a spread for sandwiches or crackers. Combine the sour cream, blue cheese, lemon zest, garlic salt, black pepper, and milk in a mixing bowl. Mix the ingredients with a fork, crumbling the blue cheese as you go. Mix it into a nice sauce. Cover, and store in the refrigerator. This sauce can be made the day before as well. Next, make the chicken. Add the flour to a plate. Add the eggs into a bowl and beat them. Add the cornmeal onto another plate. Take a chicken tender and roll it in the flour. Shake off any excess flour, then roll it in the egg mixture. Then roll it in the cornmeal and set it on a plate. Repeat with remaining chicken tenders. Next, melt 4 tablespoons of butter in the microwave, heating for 30-60 seconds or until melted. Get your broiler heated to high. Brush the butter on the inside and outside of each potato skin and place them back onto the baking sheet. Season the inside of each skin with salt and pepper. Place the skins under the broiler for 8-10 minutes or until the insides get a bit crispy from the melted butter. Remove them from the oven and prepare everything for the next step. Turn the oven down to 400 F when you pull the skins out of the oven. Next, add the canola oil into a large, non stick skillet and bring it up to a medium high heat until it reaches about 350 F. Add in the breaded chicken strips and cook for about 4 minutes per side. Once cooked remove them from the oil and place on a paper lined plate to drain any excess oil. Add the Franks Red Hot sauce and 2 tablespoons butter to a saucepan and bring that up to medium heat and cook until the butter is melted. Give that a good stir then remove from heat. Chop up the chicken and add this to a bowl. Add in the Franks Red Hot sauce and give that a good stir. Add the chicken to the top of the potato skins, and place back into a 400 F oven for about 5 minutes to heat everything through. Remove the skins from the oven, and finish assembling them. Drizzle a generous amount of the blue cheese dressing on top of the chicken, and garnish with the thinly sliced celery. Feel free to drizzle any remaining Franks Red Hot sauce over the top, and dig in. The end result is everything you would expect with great Buffalo chicken, except it is nestled into a potato skin. Its the best of both worlds. These potato skins were awesome. The spice along with the blue cheese sauce, well, lets just say youll love them. I hope you enjoy!",

In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the sifted coconut flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt until well combined. Set aside. 3. In a small bowl, microwave the Greek yogurt for 10-15 seconds, just until slightly warmed. If you add cold Greek yogurt right into the mixture, the coconut oil solidifies, leaving you with a chunky cake. 4. In a large bowl, using an electric hand mixer, beat together the eggs, coconut oil, Greek yogurt, vanilla extract and brown sugar until light and fluffy. 5. Stir in the coconut flour mixture, and then beat it to make sure that the lumps are completely gone. 6. Stir in the grated carrots until all the carrots are mixed in and coated in the batter. 7. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and let it stand for 5 minutes before baking. 8. Bake for 20-30 minutes or until the top is lightly golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove pan from oven and set it on a rack. 9. Let it cool completely. 10. Spray a 10 inch pie plate with cooking spray and set aside. 11. In a large bowl, beat together the softened cream cheese, sugar, lemon juice and vanilla until soft and fluffy. 12. Beat in the whipped topping. 13. Cut the edges off the carrot cake and set them aside. Break up the remaining cake into large chunks**. 14. Drop the cake chunks all over the bottom of the prepared 10-inch pie plate, leaving gaps between each piece. 15. Pour the cheesecake filling over the top and gently smooth over to cover the carrot cake pieces. 16. Sprinkle with the coconut flakes and place the toasted pecans along the outside edge. 17. Cover the top with tin foil and place in the freezer for at least 4 hours. 18. To serve: Remove it from the freezer. Let it thaw for about 5 minutes and then cut. It is easiest to cut and get out of the pan when the cheesecake is still quite frozen. 19. Let the slices thaw an additional 5 minutes once cut and plated, then devour. Notes: I also had success using coconut sugar instead of brown sugar, although most people slightly preferred the taste of the brown sugar version. Note that coconut sugar makes baked goods turn very dark brown, and it is wise to cover the top of the cake with parchment paper for the last 10 minutes of baking. I only used about 3/4 of the remaining carrot cake, after the edges were cut off. Its up to you depending on the ratio of carrot cake to cheesecake that you want! If you have leftover chunks, they make a great snack! Cheesecake recipe lightly adapted from Skinnytaste.",

        "Combine the Grand Marnier and simple syrup in a wide shallow bowl; set aside. Make a collar out of parchment paper: Cut a 13-by-30-inch-long piece of parchment and fold it in half lengthwise. Line the inside of a 9-inch springform pan with the paper collar, placing the folded end down. Secure the ends with a paper clip. Line the pan with the ladyfingers starting along the bottom: Dip both sides of the ladyfingers in the syrup mixture, letting them soak about 2 seconds per side. Let the excess syrup drip off, then place the ladyfingers sugar-side up on the bottom of the pan, breaking them as needed to form a single, tightly packed layer and leaving 1/4 inch of space along the edge of the pan (the ladyfingers around the outer edge will need to fit snugly into this space). Continue dipping the ladyfingers and use them to line the inner ring of the pan, standing them upright with the sugar side facing out. Loosen the parchment collar as needed to keep the ladyfingers standing upright. Fill any gaps at the bottom of the pan with broken pieces of soaked ladyfingers so that the bottom is completely covered. (As the syrup mixture soaks in, the ladyfingers will expand. They need to fit snugly next to each other, leaving no crevices on the bottom or sides, or the Bavarian cream will leak out.) Set the pan aside and reserve the remaining syrup mixture. Combine the milk, sugar, vanilla seeds and pods, and salt in a large saucepan and bring to a simmer over high heat, stirring occasionally until the sugar dissolves, about 7 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, pour the Grand Marnier into a small bowl and sprinkle the gelatin evenly over the surface; set aside. Whisk the egg yolks in a medium heatproof bowl until smooth, about 1 minute. Set a fine-mesh strainer over a large heatproof bowl; set aside. Remove the milk mixture from the heat and slowly pour about 1 cup into the egg yolks, whisking constantly until smooth. Pour the milk-egg mixture back into the pan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the custard thickens slightly and coats the spoon, about 3 to 5 minutes. (When you draw your finger across the spoon, it should make a mark through the custard, which should not run back in on itself.) Remove the custard from the heat and pour it through the strainer (dont press on the solids); discard the contents of the strainer. Whisk the gelatin mixture into the custard until dissolved and the mixture is smooth, about 2 minutes; set aside. Prepare an ice water bath by filling a large bowl halfway with ice and water. Place the custard over the ice water bath and stir often until its cooled to room temperature, about 15 minutes. When the custard is cooled, add the strawberry puree and whisk until combined. Pour the cream into a clean large bowl and whisk to medium peaks. (Alternatively, whisk in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment.) Add all of the whipped cream to the bowl of strawberry custard. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the whipped cream until evenly combined and no streaks of strawberry or whipped cream remain, scraping the bottom of the bowl as necessary to incorporate the custard. Lightly brush the tops of the exposed ladyfingers with the reserved syrup mixture (you may have some left over). Pour the strawberry Bavarian cream into the prepared pan. Refrigerate uncovered until set, at least 4 hours, then prepare the glaze. (Do not make the glaze ahead, or it will set up and be unpourable.) Set a medium-mesh strainer over a small bowl and set aside. Combine the cranberries, sugar, and 3 tablespoons of the water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium low and let simmer, stirring occasionally, until the berries are soft and starting to fall apart and the liquid has thickened slightly, about 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Pour the remaining 2 teaspoons of water into a small bowl and sprinkle the gelatin evenly over the surface; set aside. Pour the cranberry mixture into the strainer. Using a rubber spatula, push on the cranberry solids and scrape the underside of the strainer until all of the liquid is extracted; set the liquid aside and discard the contents of the strainer. Whisk the gelatin mixture into the cranberry mixture until dissolved and smooth. Set aside to cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes. Pour the cooled glaze over the surface of the charlotte russe, tilting the pan as needed so that the entire top surface is covered. Refrigerate uncovered overnight. To serve, unlock and remove the outer ring of the springform pan and discard the parchment collar. Cut the charlotte russe into slices and serve immediately. If displaying the dessert before serving, tie a decorative ribbon around the ladyfingers. The charlotte russe can sit at room temperature for about 30 to 40 minutes before it needs to be rechilled.",

With a pastry cutter (or two knives), cut the shortening in until the mixture resembles pea-sized crumbs. Take out the pastry cutter and, while stirring with a fork, add 1 Tablespoon ice cold water at a time until the dough is sticky and comes together. If the weather (or your kitchen) is warm/humid, less water will be needed. Be sure you have the consistency you want, because it's very difficult to add more water. Form half the dough into a ball with your hands, and flatten the ball into a 1/2\" thickness, rounding the edges. Place the dough onto a lightly floured surface (you can place between sheets of wax or parchment paper, if that is easier), and roll into a 10\" circle (roll with your wrists doing the work, not your shoulders. I saw that on a Bobby Flay - Pie Throwdown episode). Gently transfer to a 9\" pie plate. Gently press the pastry down into the plate, being sure not to stretch or tear the dough. If it does tear a little, just take some off the edge, and \"patch\" it. Create a decorative edge around the top, and cut any extra crust off of the edge.

Chop their flesh into 1/2-inch pieces and set aside. Heat a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat for about 3 minutes. While it is heating, sprinkle the scallops with salt and pepper and spread the curry powder on a plate. 2. Add the oil, then quickly dredge the scallops lightly in the curry powder and add them to the pan. About 2 minutes after you added the first scallop, turn it;it should be nicely browned (if it is not, raise the heat a bit). When the scallops are all browned and turned, cook for another minute, then add the tomatoes and the cream if you're using it (if you are using yogurt, lower the heat immediately; it must not boil). 3. Heat the tomatoes through, then taste and add more salt and pepper if necessary. Sprinkle with the lime juice, stir in the cilantro, and serve. SINCE YOU'RE USING a large quantity of curry powder here, it should not be super-hot. (This is obviously a matter of taste, but I prefer a mild, sweet curry.) The powder itself must be fairly fine; if it is too coarse, the resulting crust will be gritty rather than crisp. DREDGE THE SCALLOPS lightly in the curry, not as heavily as you would in flour.

Whisk in milk and bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Reduce heat and simmer, whisking occasionally, 5 minutes. Whisk in salt, pepper, nutmeg, and 1/3 cup cheese until cheese is melted. Remove from heat and cover surface directly with a sheet of wax paper. Make sandwiches: Spread 1 1/2 tablespoons sauce evenly over each of 4 slices of bread, then sprinkle evenly with remaining cheese (1/4 cup per slice). Spread mustard evenly on remaining 4 bread slices and top with ham, dividing it evenly, then invert onto the cheese-topped bread to form sandwiches. Lightly oil a 15- by 10-inch shallow baking pan. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately low heat, then cook the sandwiches, turning over once, until golden, 3 to 4 minutes total. Remove from heat and transfer sandwiches to baking pan, then wipe out skillet with paper towels. Preheat broiler. Top each sandwich with 1/3 cup sauce, spreading evenly. Broil sandwiches 4 to 5 inches from heat until sauce is bubbling and golden in spots, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off broiler and transfer pan to lower third of oven to keep sandwiches warm. Heat remaining tablespoon butter in nonstick skillet over moderate heat until foam subsides, then crack eggs into skillet and season with salt and pepper. Fry eggs, covered, until whites are just set and yolks are still runny, about 3 minutes. Top each sandwich with a fried egg and serve immediately.",

        "Use a large pot, preferably with a heavy bottom. Cut chicken into serving pieces or use ready-cut chicken pieces (do NOT use skinned, boned breasts). Put in a bowl, scatter over the flour, and then turn over and over to coat more or less. Just more or less. Heat pot over high heat. Add a generous amount of oil like canola, heat a few seconds, then add the chopped onion. In this case the onion can be in large chunks -- the idea is that you do NOT get tearful over a plain stew. Stir the sizzling onion. Add the chicken. Keep the heat high, and although there won't be space for all the pieces to lie flat, no matter. Let the pieces below fry until they start browning, then stir the whole lot around with a wooden spoon with a long handle. Let bottom pieces brown -- but not every piece needs to be fried first. This frying is just to get extra flavour. In the meantime you have opened the tin of tomatoes. Hopefully it's of good quality, solid, with thick liquid -- not just a few tomato bits and thin juice. (If it's the latter -- add a few splotches of ketchup to the pot). Dump it over the furiously frying chicken and onion, and add the sugar. Stir the lot again. At this stage you might want to add a dash of water, just to stop the whole lot burning. One-third cup water, no more. Add some salt, which should preferably be your favourite seasoned salt, as modern chickens are not known for their flavour. You'll have to add more later. Turn heat to low, put lid on, make sure nothing burns and the stew bubbles gently. Now walk away for 20 minutes and do something else, or put the rice on to cook. Return to the stew, take off the lid, and add the potatoes, mushrooms, Worcestershire sauce, garlic and pepper sauce or hot pepper flakes -- not too much. You want a bite, not Jaws. Add more salt at this stage, and taste. There should by now be a satisfactory sort of sauce in the pot. If you think a flavour is missing, add it, it's your stew. Put the lid back on, and simmer for another 15 minutes or so, until the potatoes are cooked through. With a large spoon remove the entire saucy stew to an oven dish. If you have too much sauce, keep the rest, cool and refrigerate, and use as a soup base -- it's delicious and can't go to waste. If you don't have enough sauce it's your own fault, as you probably let the liquid all cook away. At this point, stir in any herbs or parsley you want to use. Chopped rosemary or oregano is great. Cover dish with foil, and keep warm until serving. Like all stews, it will improve in taste if it stands a while. It's usually best to make a stew a day ahead. *The mushrooms -- yes, their flavour will be lost in the tomato. They're added for texture, for that extra little soft bite, not really because they're mushrooms. You can substitute with chopped small zucchini. Serve with a green vegetable and rice, and in this house a salad will be expected too.",

Discard guts and lay the halved, gutted tomatoes face down on a clean towel. Chop up your herbs and garlic and mix with the Ricotta cheese. Add salt and pepper to taste. Next, fill each tomato half with a nice heap of the Ricotta mixture. In a food processor (or if you dont have a food processor, you can mash in a plastic baggy with a rolling pin) crumble about 15-20 Ritz crackers. Or you can use dried bread crumbs from your favorite kind of bread if you want. Press each ricotta filled tomato half face down into the crackers/crumbs and then place face up on a baking sheet. Drizzle each tomato with a bit of olive oil. Place in 400 degrees oven for 25-30 minutes.",

Use the back of a spoon (or your clean fingers) to press crumbs to form a bottom crust. For the pecans: Heat butter on the stove in a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Once melted add pecans and brown sugar and cook until sugar begins to melt, shaking the pan occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir until sugar caramelizes and thickens into a syrup-like consistency. Remove from heat. Spoon pecans onto a sheet of parchment paper, spread evenly and allow to cool completely. Break apart if needed once cooled. For the cheesecake: In a large bowl using a mixer, whip cream cheese until smooth. Continue to mix as sour cream is added. Mix well. Add in one egg at a time, mixing in between additions, then add maple syrup. Continue to mix until very smooth. For assembly: Preheat oven to 350 F. Sprinkle about 1 1/2 tablespoons of caramelized pecans onto the crust in each ramekin (save some pecans for garnish if desired). Top with roughly 1 cup of the cheesecake mixture.

Place the dishes (ramekins still inside of the water bath) into the oven and bake for 40-45 minutes, or until the center of each cheesecake is set. Remove from the oven, allow to cool, then place ramekins into the refrigerator to chill for at least one hour prior to serving (can be made the day before which is a big bonus for holiday meal prep).

For the onions: Thinly slice up 2 onions (1 onion per steak). Throw it in a hot skillet with 1 1/2 Tablespoons of butter (melted). Season with salt and pepper. Cook for about 15 minutes, until the onions are really soft and caramelized. You really want there to be brown bits on the bottom of the pan. So much good flavor. Once your onions have started to get brown, add half a bottle of dark beer. I went with Shiners new Double Wheat and oh my, was it delicious. To that, add 1/2 cup beef stock and 1 overflowing Tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. Turn the heat down to medium low and continue cooking for about 10 minutes. For the potatoes: Not that I ever get sick of my extreme garlic mashed potatoes, but sometimes its nice to try something new. These dijon spinach mashed potatoes sounded perfect. I like the flavor of Yukon Gold potatoes, so I went with those and quartered them before throwing them in salted, boiling water and cooking for 20 minutes. After you drain your potatoes, add them to a bowl with half of the fresh spinach on the bottom. Top the potatoes with salt and pepper, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 2-3 Tablespoons of dijon mustard and some freshly grated nutmeg. Add another heaping handful spinach and mash together. For the grand finale, take your perfectly cooked ribeye, top with it your drunken onions and serve along side your dijon potato mash. Marvel at how easy it was to make one of the most delicious meals of your life. Seriously. I dont know whether it was the quality of the meat, the combination of the onions and beer or the new twist on mashed potatoes, but this meal is one for the books.",

Cook, stirring to break up the meat, until the pork is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add the peppers and noodles. Turn the heat to high, and add almost all of the sauce (save a spoonful or two to add later if needed). Cook, tossing everything together and separating the noodles if necessary, until the noodles are coated in sauce and take on a slightly charred flavor from the wok. Taste, and add more sauce if needed. Toss in the basil and the smashed chiles, and serve immediately.",

        "First, make sure that the phyllo dough is wrapped in a wet kitchen towel as it thaws in its plastic covering. This will keep it from drying out. Prepare the walnut filling. I used my food processor to grind the walnuts pretty finely but still keeping some texture. Then stir the ground walnuts, sugar, and cinnamon together in a mixing bowl. Set it aside. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and get out a 9 x 13 baking dish. Brush the bottom of the baking dish liberally with a little of the melted butter. Take half of the thawed phyllo dough, leaving the other half still wrapped in the wet towel. Gently roll it out flat. Layer each sheet of it one by one in the baking dish, brushing lots of the melted butter in between each sheet. If it tears a little, not to worry! Once the first half of phyllo dough is layered in the pan, evenly layer the walnut mixture on top of it. Then repeat the process of layering the phyllo with the second half of the dough to top off the baklava. With a sharp knife, cut diagonal parallel lines from one side of the pan to the other. Then cut the same lines going the opposite way to cut the baklava into the classic diamond shapes. Get the baking dish into the oven to bake at 350 degrees F for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 300 and let it continue to bake for another 4045 minutes. When there is about 20 minutes left of baking time, prepare the syrup. Combine the sugar, water and lemon slices in a sauce pan and heat it up over medium high heat. Let it gently boil for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Once the 15 minutes is up, remove the lemon slices and stir in the honey. Take the pot off of the heat and let it cool for around 5 minutes. It needs to cool enough so that it doesnt wilt the baklava but it also shouldnt cool so much that it hardens. Stir occasionally while it cools. Take the baklava out when its done and immediately pour the syrup all over it. It will just melt all over it and make it gloriously sticky. Let it cool enough to handle, then cut out the individual diamond pieces and serve! It will also keep sealed up in an airtight container for a couple of days. Enjoy!",

Return the sanma in the pan and reduce the sauce (water prevents reducing the sauce too quickly, but it's unnecessary if you're careful enough). Flip over!

Stir 100 times (one minute) in the same direction to activate the gluten in the flour. Let this sponge rest for at least 30 minutes or as long as 2 hours. Sprinkle salt over the sponge and stir in the olive oil. Mix well. Add remaining white flour, one cup at a time (more if needed). When the dough is too stiff to stir, turn it out onto a lightly floured bread board and knead for 8 to 10 minutes, until dough is smooth and elastic. Return the dough to a lightly oiled bread bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until at least double in size, approximately 1 1/2 hours. Gently punch down. NOTE: If at this time you want to save the dough in the refrigerator for baking later, simply wrap it in a plastic bag that is at least three times the size of the dough, pull the bag together, and secure it just at the opening of the bag. This will give the dough a chance to expand when it is in the refrigerator (which it will do). From day to day, simply cut off the amount of dough you need and keep the rest in the refrigerator, for up 5 days. The dough will smell slightly fermented after a few days, but this simply improves the taste of the bread. Dough should be brought to room temperature before baking. Place unglazed quarry tiles, or a large baking stone or two baking sheets, on a rack in the bottom third of your oven, leaving a one inch gap all around to allow air to circulate. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Divide dough in half, then set half aside, covered, while you work with the rest. Divide dough into eight equal pieces and flatten each piece with lightly floured hands. Roll out each piece to a circle 8\" in diameter and about 1/4\" thick. NOTE: You may wish to roll out all eight before starting to bake. Cover rolled out breads, but do not stack. Bake 2 at a time (or more if your oven is larger) directly on quarry tiles or baking sheets. Bake each bread for 3-4 minutes, until the bread has gone into a full \"balloon\" or until it is starts to turn lightly golden, whichever happens first. NOTE: Your bread may not go into a full \"balloon\" but don't worry, it will still taste great. The more you bake pitas the more you will become familiar with all the little tricks and pitfalls, and your breads will more consistently balloon. Remove pitas from the oven and place on a rack for for a few minutes to let cool slightly (I leave them on the rack until the next two are ready to come out of the oven), then wrap breads in a large kitchen towel (this will keep the breads soft).",

Drop diced butter into the hole and pour the beaten egg and the cold water in. Stir until all is combined. Knead the dough for 1 minute until it forms a ball. Wrap the dough with plastic wrap or parchment paper. Take to the fridge and let it rest for 1 hour. After an hour of chilling remove dough from the fridge, unwrap it and place on a lightly floured surface. Roll out the dough into 1/4 inch thickness. You must roll out the dough according to the shape of your baking pan. You may use a baking pan (13 x 9) or a round springform pan (8 diameter). Gently remove the rolled out dough from the working surface and center it in the baking pan. Place in the fridge for 5 minutes. Then, heat the oven to 325 F. Then remove crust from the fridge and using a fork, prick the dough several times. Bake for 15 minutes. Then remove it from the oven and set it on a wire rack to cool. If you are preparing the whole lime pie recipe right away, do not turn off the oven heat. For the lime custard filling: In a medium bowl, mix the sweetened condensed milk and the lime juice until all is combined. Then, add the egg yolks and stir until all is incorporated. Pour this mixture onto the baked crust. Set aside. For the meringue top: In a medium pot, combine 3/4 cup of sugar and 1/3 cup of water. Over a medium heat, bring to boil and cook for approximately 3-5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. In a medium sized bowl beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Add 1/3 cup of sugar gradually, while continuing to whip. Whip until the sugar is dissolved. With the stand mixer still on, gradually pour the sugar syrup into it. Whip until the cream has cooled. Spread the meringue over the filling. With the oven already preheated (325 F), bake the lime pie for 35 minutes or until the meringue golden.

Smash to lightly bruise each herb separately (careful not to mix flavors on your cutting board or knife) and place each into its own vessel with the salt. Shake and/or rub salt thoroughly with the herb. One other option would be to gently push salt and herb around in a mortar and pestle. That will generate a stronger if not harsher flavor. You can also just throw the herb in the salt, but it may take longer to scent. Let the salts sit until desired strength of flavor is attained, anywhere from several days to several months. You may choose to leave the herbs in, but I would probably recommend taking them out, especially if they were not entirely desiccated to begin with. If you live somewhere humid, make sure your salts dont become damp. you can do this by first spreading them out on a piece of wax paper or parchment paper to allow full drying.",

        "For the pudding: In a medium-sized saucepan, heat 2-1/2 cups milk over medium heat. In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine the remaining 1/2 cup milk, sugar, cornstarch, flour, egg yolks, and salt, to make a paste. Also, in a separate mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. When milk is slightly warm, add the sugar mixture to the saucepan, stirring constantly. Add vanilla and butter and bring the mixture to a boil. Once it boils, turn heat to medium low, just so pudding continues at a low boil, for about 5 minutes, or until thick. Then, remove from heat and cool for about 2 minutes. Then carefully fold in the egg whites. Let the mixture cool slightly, then put it into another container and refrigerate for a minimum of 2 hours (can be refrigerated overnight). Crust: Preheat oven to 350F. Combine 3/4 cups of flour and 1/4 cups powdered sugar in small mixing bowl. Cut in the butter until crumbs form. Then press this mixture into a greased pan (can be either a 9x9 square or regular pie pan). Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until crust is just baked. Let cool. Peanut butter crumbs: Combine 1 cup of powdered sugar and the peanut butter with a fork until crumbs form. For the assembly: In your pan with your crust (already baked), top with approximately half of the peanut butter crumbs. Then cover with all of the vanilla pudding. Top with Cool Whip, then remaining peanut butter crumbs. Ive never had luck with making perfect pie crusts. When I discovered this method, I was quite pleased!

Wash your lime and roll it under your hand on the counter top to help it release more juice. You can also put it in the microwave for about 30 seconds or so, then roll it. Juice the lime. Sure you can use juice from a bottle, but fresh makes a difference. Plus you get real lime zest. Lime zest is hard to find in the spice section, at least around here. Zest the lime until you get at least a teaspoon. I also added a few thin strips of lime peel (try not to get much pith -the white part-) because I love candied citrus peel. Put into your pan in order, sugar, pectin, berries, then lime. The breadmaker commandments say it matters. I didn't do it that way because I am a rebel and it turned out fine. Put your bowl into the breadmaker. Turn it to the jam setting. Let her rip! Check it at about 5 minutes in then maybe 5 minutes later, just to make sure nothing is sticking to the side. Other than that, it's like magic and does it without your input. Go for a run, watch an episode of your favorite TV drama, or chill for about 90 minutes.

Place pan into the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, until lightly browned and the doughnuts spring back when touched lightly. Remove doughnuts from the oven and let them cool in the pan for a couple of minutes, then remove them gently to a cooling rack and let them cool completely. For the chocolate glaze: Heat the cream over low heat in a saucepan, just until small bubbles form around the edges of the pan. Remove from the heat and pour the hot cream over the chocolate chips that you have waiting in a large heatproof bowl. Stir slowly until all of the chocolate is melted and you have a nice smooth mixture. Stir in the vanilla. Let stand for a few minutes until lukewarm. Dip each doughnut into the glaze and put them back on the rack until the glaze is set. Makes 6 regular sized doughnuts.",

I generally dont check the temperature, as long as you can stick your finger in comfortably it will be fine, but you can check the temperature if youre nervous about killing the yeast! Stir everything together with a wooden spoon or dough whisk until all of the flour is hydrated. There should not be any dry pieces left at all. This will take a couple of minutes of stirring. Once all the flour is mixed in, you will have a rather shaggy mass of dough in the bowl. Cover this tightly with plastic wrap and let it rise for 2 hours, or until the dough has doubled in size. Prepare a 9x13 inch pan by brushing 1 tablespoon of olive oil over the bottom and sides. In a small bowl, stir together the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil with the room temp water and kosher salt. Once the dough has doubled in size, sprinkle a bit of flour over the dough, just so it isnt as sticky and you can handle it a bit. Turn it over a couple times in the bowl with floured hands so that you have a lightly floured ball of dough, but without kneading it and removing all the air bubbles. You want to handle this dough gently and just use enough flour so you can move the dough around without having it stuck all over your hands. Move the dough to the prepared baking pan and press it out with your hands to fill the pan. It may not quite reach the edges everywhere or be a perfect rectangle. Thats okay. Brush the olive oil and salt mixture over the top of the bread, making sure to use all of it, and then sprinkle the top with rosemary. Cover the pan with plastic wrap or a clean towel and let it rest for 45 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 F. When the dough has rested, uncover it, place the pan into the hot oven, and bake for 25-27 minutes until it is golden brown. Remove pan from oven. Let bread cool in the pan for couple of minutes and then lift it out to cool on a wire rack. Serve warm with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, or just plain if you prefer! Note: This bread is great right out of the oven with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, or even plain. The salty olive oil brushed crust is delicious without anything else added to it. Leftovers are great for sandwiches or paninis if you have any left! Also, this recipe can be easily halved to fit in a 9x9 inch pan, or doubled to do two pans of bread. Or, you can double it, use 1/4 to 1/2 of the dough to bake immediately, and store the remainder in the fridge for up to a week. When youre ready to bake it simply take it out and allow it to come to room temperature (about 2-3 hours) and then continue with the shaping and baking instructions.

Gradually add flour. When dough holds together, it is ready for kneading. (You can also use a mixer with a dough hook for both mixing and kneading.) Turn dough onto a floured surface and knead until smooth. Clean out bowl and grease it, then return dough to bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, until almost doubled in size. Dough may also rise in an oven that has been warmed to 150 degrees then turned off. Punch down dough, cover and let rise again in a warm place for another half-hour. To make a 6-braid challah, either straight or circular, take half the dough and form it into 6 balls. With your hands, roll each ball into a strand about 12 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide. Place the 6 in a row, parallel to one another. Pinch the tops of the strands together. Move the outside right strand over 2 strands. Then take the second strand from the left and move it to the far right. Take the outside left strand and move it over 2. Move second strand from the right over to the far left. Start over with the outside right strand. Continue this until all strands are braided. For a straight loaf, tuck ends underneath. For a circular loaf, twist into a circle, pinching ends together. Make a second loaf the same way. Place braided loaves on a greased cookie sheet with at least 2 inches in between. Beat remaining egg and brush it on loaves. Either freeze breads or let rise another hour. If baking immediately, preheat oven to 375 degrees and brush loaves again. If freezing, remove from freezer 5 hours before baking. Then dip your index finger in the egg wash, then into poppy or sesame seeds and then onto a mound of bread.

(Rinse the rice quickly before you add it.) Turn on the heat. When the pan comes to a boil turn the heat down to low, put a lid on and simmer for 20 minutes. Be sure to mix it several times or the rice will get stuck to the bottom of the pan! Once the daikon radish is tender, add the ingredients (dashi stock granules, soy sauce, Ajinomoto seasoning), put the lid back on and simmer for an additional 15 to 20 minutes. Check frequently and stir well to make sure the rice doesn't get stuck to the bottom. When the daikon radish is very soft, turn the heat off. Add the katakuriko dissolved in water and stir lightly. Turn the heat back on to thicken the sauce. I simmered it for a total of 40 minutes. Put some hot rice in a bowl, spoon plenty of this on top, and enjoy. If you leave it to cool down once with the lid on, the flavors will really penetrate the ingredients well and become really delicious. I recommend making this in advance and re-heating it before serving. I watched my mother make this back home and it looked different from mine, so I asked her to check my recipe and it was wrong. So I edited the original posted recipe. According to my mother, the daikon radish to water to ground meat ratio should be strictly 1:1:1. So it's 100 g daikon radish: 100 ml water : 100 g ground meat - for the balance of ingredients that I think is best! I use Ajinomoto brand umami seasoning in this. If you leave it out the flavor will be very different (in terms of saltiness and depth) so please adjust the seasoning by tasting it.",

        "In a liquid measuring cup, heat milk/water to \"wrist-warm\" (do NOT boil; just warm). Add yeast and 2 tablespoons of the sugar (you'll use the rest in the next step). Stir the yeast and sugar; let this \"work\" for about 5 or 10 minutes. You should have some bubbly, frothy stuff in the cup when you return. (If not--your yeast is no good, dump it out and get better yeast. ). Pour yeast-milk into mixing bowl, and add remaining sugar, butter, eggs, salt and 1 cup of the flour. Using beater, mix this mess for about a minute. Switch to the paddle (flat beater) or a dough hook, and add remaining flour one cup-at-a-time. The dough will form a ball, and feel slightly sticky. You may not need the entire 5 1/2 cups (depends on humidity, too). Fill medium glass bowl with hottest tap water. If your oven can be adjusted to 100 degrees, set it to 100 degrees. Also, if your oven has a light, turn it on; place the hot water on the bottom of the oven. Close the door. Grease a large, glass bowl. Remove dough from mixing bowl to a floured table/counter-top; knead for 1 minute; form into a ball and place in greased bowl, turning to get grease on all sides. Cover bowl loosely with a sheet of plastic wrap. Turn off 100 degree oven, place bowl of dough into oven; close the door. Set the timer for 1 hour. Clean up the mess BUT leave floured counter-top AS IS. At the end of one hour the dough should've risen to about double the size. If not, let it go for another 15 minutes (set the timer--it's easy to forget---out of sight, out of mind! ). Gather filling ingredients: 1/4 cup of melted butter; cinnamon; brown sugar; raisins and/or chopped nuts (optional). Punch down the down; remove from bowl; with a large butcher knife, cut dough into two equal parts. Set one aside (cover with plastic wrap). Grease two 13x9-inch pans with BUTTER (no substitutes are allowed -- this is GRAMMA's recipe). :-) humor me, okay?. On floured counter-top, lay dough and with a rolling pin, shape & roll into large rectangle, oh about 8 x 16 inches or a bit larger, keep thickness consistent throughout. Pour HALF of the melted butter over this, and spread with a pastry brush, right out to the edges. Sprinkle generously with cinnamon (like 1-2 tablespoons), then a handful of brown sugar, spreading it evenly with fingers; right to the edges! Sprinkle some raisins and chopped nuts -- if using. Keep these closer to the long side closest to you. HERE's THE HARD PART: Starting at the side closest to you, LOOSELY roll away from you. Loosely is the KEY word. Tuck in any runaway raisins or nuts. Use that big knife to divide the roll in half in the middle. Then cut each half into SIX equal portions, for a total of 12 rolls. Starting in the middle of the roll (nicest shaped rolls) and working to the sloppy outside roll piecs, set them along the outside edges of the buttered pan, spacing evenly in the pan. Put the two end rolls in the very center of the pan. Set the cut side DOWN (so the top looks flat-ish). Set this pan on the stove for now. Repeat with remaining dough; vary the ingredients -- if you skipped raisins or nuts, maybe add some to this pan of rolls. Check if the water in the oven is still warm, if not dump out and start with fresh hot water. Put plastic wrap on both pans (re-use the other piece), and pop in the warm oven. Set the timer for 45 minutes. Go do something productive---clean the counter-top before all that stuff gets hard! :-D. When the rolls have risen to the top of the pan (or a smidgen over), remove them from the oven, preheat oven to 350. When it's warm bake them for 20 minutes; tops will be golden brown. Cool on a rack; then frost with a cream cheese/butter cream frosting (slather it on thick like Gramma does for the grandkids! ). You have JUST entered the Pearly Gates!",

Fry the tomato and garlic in olive oil in the large paellera (special paella pan), then add the rice, stir for a minute and then add the chicken, chicken stock (there should be 6 glasses), artichokes, red peppers, the juice of half a lemon, black pepper, parsley, thyme, rosemary, the saffron strands (grind them first. If you haven't got a grinder, use Colorante which you'll find in the spice and herbs racks in supermarkets) and salt. Once all the ingredients are in the paella pan, turn the heat up to maximum and boil for about 10 minutes. Then lower the heat and leave to simmer for another 10 minutes. After 20 minutes, the liquid should have evaporated. Turn off the heat, and leave to stand for five minutes. If possible cover while it is standing (many Spaniards use paper to cover the pan).

Stir in the flour, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside until doubled in size, about 30 minutes. Place the water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and sprinkle the yeast on top. Set aside until the mixture bubbles, about 10 minutes. Add the sponge, eggs, flour, and sugar and mix on low speed until the dough just starts to come together and looks shaggy, about 2 minutes. Increase the speed to medium, add the butter 1 piece at a timeletting each piece incorporate before adding the nextand mix until the dough forms a sticky ball on the paddle, about 4 minutes total. Stop the mixer, scrape down the paddle with a rubber spatula, and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let the dough rest in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Wash and dry the paddle attachment and fit it back onto the mixer. Fit the bowl with the first dough onto the stand mixer. Add the eggs, yolks, sugar, honey, vanilla, and salt and mix on low speed until combined, about 1 minute. Increase the speed to medium high, add the butter pieces, and mix until smooth, about 2 to 4 minutes. Decrease the speed to low, gradually add the flour, and mix until smooth, about 2 minutes. Stop the mixer and, using a rubber spatula or rubber bowl scraper, scrape down the sides of the bowl and the paddle. Remove the paddle attachment and attach the dough hook. Mix on medium speed for 10 minutes. (The dough will be very soft.) Coat a large bowl with a thin layer of vegetable oil and scrape the dough into it. Tightly cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and transfer it to a work surface. Using a sharp knife or pastry scraper, divide the dough into 2 equal pieces and form each into a ball. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, prepare the molds and filling. Generously coat 2 (6-by-4-inch) panettone molds with butter. Place the molds on a baking sheet and set them aside. Place the raisins in a medium bowl, cover them with water, and let them soak for 30 minutes. Drain the raisins, wipe the bowl dry, pat the raisins dry, and return them to the bowl. Add the candied zest, lemon zest, orange zest, and 3 tablespoons of the flour and toss to evenly coat; set aside. When the dough balls are ready, place the remaining 3/4 cup of flour in a small bowl to use while finishing and shaping the dough (you may not use all of the flour). Generously dust the work surface with flour, place the dough balls on it, and dust the tops with more flour. Using floured hands, pat each ball into an oval measuring 13 1/2 by 12 inches (about 1/4 inch thick), flouring the dough as needed. Evenly sprinkle a quarter of the fruit mixture over each oval and gently press it into the dough. Starting at a shorter end, roll each oval into a log. Using floured hands and flouring the dough as needed, pat each log into an oval measuring 16 by 7 inches (about 1/2 inch thick). Divide the remaining fruit mixture in half. Evenly sprinkle half over 1 oval and the remaining half over the other oval and gently press the fruit into the dough. Starting at a shorter end, roll each oval into a log and arrange them seam-side down. Tuck the ends of each log under itself and shape each into a ball, pushing any fruit pieces back in that fall out. Using a sharp knife or razor blade, cut a shallow 4-inch X into the top of each ball and place them in the prepared molds. Cover the molds with plastic wrap and let the panettone rise on the baking sheet in a warm place until increased in size by half, about 2 hours. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 400 degrees F and arrange a rack in the bottom third. Using the sharp knife or razor blade, retrace the X in each loaf. Cut the tablespoon of butter in half and tuck 1 portion into the center of each X. Place the baking sheet with the panettone in the oven and bake for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and bake for 10 minutes more. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees F and bake until the tops of the panettone are golden brown and a wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 to 40 minutes more. Meanwhile, twist 2 clean, dry kitchen towels into ropes and arrange them in a small circle. Repeat with 2 more towels. Remove each panettone from the oven and arrange it on its side cradled in a towel circle. (If you cool the panettone upright, theyll collapse.) Let them cool completely before slicing, at least 1 1/2 hours. Remove the panettone from the molds, slice with a serrated knife, and serve.",

Sprinkle the apples with sugar and thyme and cook over medium low heat in a small skillet until the apples soften, collapse, and turn into a chunky sauce, about 20 minutes. Add water as necessary to the skillet so the apples dont scorch and burn. Smash down any stubborn pieces that refuse to turn into sauce. Cool completely. Once cooled, blend the butter and apples together using an electric hand mixer or whisk. Chill until ready to use. Now make the biscuits... Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda together in a large bowl. Work shortening into flour using a pastry blender or fingertips until you have coarse looking crumbs and the shortening is distributed throughout the flour mixture. Add walnuts and 1 cup of the blue cheese, again, using a pastry blender or fingertips work dough until blended. Make a well in the center of the mixture and add buttermilk. Stir using a spoon or spatula until a dough forms. Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and knead until combined. The dough will not be completely smooth like a pie crust but should hold together and be a little elastic. Form into a rectangle about 1/4 inch thick, then use a pizza slicer to cut into 16 squares (if you prefer round biscuits...have at it! ). Place biscuits on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush with a little buttermilk, sprinkle with remaining blue cheese and bake for 25 minutes until golden brown. Serve warm or at room temperature with apple butter.",

        "Use a block of pork belly. It's a bit different from the \"three layer meat\" (skin, fat, meat) they use in Okinawa, but it works well. Cover the meat with salt, and rub it in well. I wrote down an amount of salt for the recipe, but basically you should pack the meat completely in salt. Wrap the salted meat with newspaper. You can use paper towels too, but here we'll rely on the absorbent nature of newspaper. Put the wrapped meat in a ziplock bag, eliminate the air from the bag and seal it up. Let it rest in the refrigerator for about 4 days. Wash the pork well to remove the salt. Bring a pot of water with the green part of a leek and ginger to a boil, and put in the pork. Skim off any scum. When you have removed the scum, boil the pork for about 1 hour. Use a big pot with plenty or water, or the water will boil off while you're cooking the pork. Rinse the boiled pork again. Slice about 6-7mm thick (like the pork slices on ramen noodles). Pan fry with a little oil over high heat until crispy. Transfer to serving plates, sprinkle with some chopped green onion and enjoy! Here is what I served when I made this recipe. Red beans and rice (osekihan), suuchikaa with cabbage and cucumber, green bean salad, and egg plant and aburaage miso soup.",

        "Timing note: The cooking time includes 30 minutes for cooling the custard mixture,6 hours for chilling the mousse once it is made and divided among dessert bowls, and an optional 15 minutes to soften the refrigerated mousse just before serving. You will also need: 1. A double boiler or homemade bain-marie made out of a pot partially filled with water and a heatproof bowl that will fit in the rim of the pot without touching the bottom. 2. A candy or deep-fry thermometer. 3. A whisk. 4. Two mixing bowls. 5. An electric mixer, standing or hand. 6. A spatula. 7. Six 1/2-cup size ramekins or dessert bowls. 1. In the top part of the double boiler or the bowl of the homemade bain-marie, whisk together 3/4 cup of the cream, the egg yolks, sugar and salt. 2. Hook the thermometer on the side of the bowl and cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly with a whisk. The mixture will become foamy and a thin yellow coating of custard will begin to cling to the sides of the bowl. At this point, the thermometer will register between 150 F and 160 F and the custard is done. 3. Pour the custard into a bowl, stir in the vanilla and set the custard aside. 4. Rinse out the top of the double boiler or bowl of the bain-marie and put the chocolate in it. Place the double boiler or bain-marie back on the burner, over medium heat, and melt the chocolate, stirring as it melts. 5. Whisk the hot melted chocolate into the custard. Set it aside to cool at room temperature for, around 30 minutes. 6. Put the remaining 1 and 1/4 cups of cream into a bowl and use the mixer to beat it until it just holds stiff peaks and doesnt slide up the sides of the bowl. 7. Fold a dollop of the whipped cream into the custard to lighten the mixture. Then fold the custard, gently and thoroughly, back into the remaining cream. 8. Divide the mousse among dessert bowls or ramekins. Cover each with a piece of plastic wrap and chill them for at least 6 hours. Its preferable to let the dessert stand at room temperature for 15 minutes to soften a bit right before serving. However, if time constraints or forgetfulness prevail, serve the mousse straight from the refrigerator and all will still be well. Any extra servings keep just fine for several days refrigerated.",

If, however, the crust still crumbles apart and wont stay together when pinched, that means it wont stay together while rolling either; so go ahead and add the last tablespoon of water one teaspoon at a time, rechecking the consistency between each teaspoon. The exact amount of water you need will depend on the amount of humidity in the air and therefore in the flour. Once finished, turn the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap. Form the dough into a disk, and refrigerate 30 minutes before rolling it out. You want that flour to relax and the butter to be nice and cold that will ensure you have a nice flaky crust. Meanwhile, boil a pot of water large enough to fit the stalks of asparagus. Trim the ends of your asparagus making sure they will fit nicely into your quiche pan, arranged like the spokes in a bicycle wheel with the ends touching in the middle. Place the stalks in boiling water, and blanch for 2-3 minutes. Remove from boiling water and place in an ice bath to stop the cooking and keep the color nice and vibrant green. Set aside. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a circle a few inches larger than your quiche or pie pan. Fold the dough back up over the rolling pin if needed, to gently lift the crust into the dish. Once the dough is neatly into the pan, make sure it is smoothly tucked into the corners. Trim excess crust from the edges leaving about a 1 border. Fold the excess dough under itself, making sure not to fold it over the edge of the pan, to ensure a nice even border. Crimp the dough between your fingers to make little pinches. Poke a few fork holes in it to allow the steam to escape, this will prevent a soggy bottom crust. Blind bake the crust for 5 minutes. This will prevent all of the custard from getting absorbed into the crust making it soggy. Remove crust from oven and sprinkle with Havarti with Dill cheese. Set aside. Increase oven temperature to 375 degrees F. In a large bowl, combine eggs, heavy cream, and milk and whisk thoroughly. Pour egg mixture gently over the cheese mixture. Place asparagus stalks, tips pointing outwards into a spoke pattern like on a bicycle wheel, making sure the ends come together in the middle. Bake 40 minutes. At that point, ceck to make sure the crust isnt getting too brown. If it is, then loosely drape a piece of foil over the top, making sure you dont lay it on the actual custard mixture in the middle. Bake 10-12 minutes longer. To test doneness, slide a butter knife under the edge of one of the asparagus stalks. The knife should come out clean. It should be moist after all the quiche is moist, but the knife should be free of egg mixture. If not, put it back in the oven with your tent foil on top for 3-4 more minutes.",

Put in the oven and roast until cooked through, about 35 minutes. Remove the chicken from the oven to a cutting board and let cool. Once cool enough to handle, shred the chicken meat with a fork and set aside. Cook's Note: Can be done the day before. Turn the oven temperature up to 400 degrees F. Put a pizza stone in the oven to preheat for 1 hour, for best results. Remove the pizza dough from refrigerator and let come to room temperature, so it will be easier to work with. Sauce: Heat a medium saucepan over medium-high heat and coat the bottom with the olive oil. Once hot, add the garlic and saute until fragrant. Add the tomato paste and stir to toast. This will add depth of flavor. Stir in the tomato puree, chili powder, paprika, cumin, and oregano and bring up to a simmer. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, for the flavors to marry together. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper. Vegetables: Thinly coat a large saute pan with olive oil and heat over a medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the peppers, onion and garlic. Saute until the onions are translucent, about 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Remove and set aside. To assemble: Flour the counter top and roll out the pizza dough to a 13-inch diameter. Carefully remove the pizza stone from the oven and put the dough on top.

After serving Beef Pot Roast from the slow cooker, pull out some of the meat with a bit of its juice, and set it aside. Youll need about 3 cups of meat. To the meat, add taco seasoning and your favorite salsa. (I use mild, but its up to you!) Cover and set to marinate in the fridge overnight or for up to 3 days. To prepare enchiladas: Set oven to 350 degrees. Pour enchilada sauce into a microwave-safe bowl and heat on high for 2.5 minutes. (Make sure when purchasing your enchilada sauce to pay attention to the choices between hot or mild. I always use mild because I am a big chicken when it comes to spicy foods, and so are my kids.) Spray a casserole dish with nonstick spray. Heat marinated beef in a separate microwave-safe bowl for 3 minutes. Gently whisk together sour cream with warmed enchilada sauce to create a creamy, dreamy concoction. Set up an assembly line of warmed meat, warmed enchilada sauce, and tortillas next to the casserole dish. Begin assembling enchiladas by dipping each tortilla in the bowl of creamy enchilada sauce until the tortilla is completely covered. Place the drenched tortilla on a plate and spoon meat into a line down the center of the tortilla. Fold both ends of the tortilla slightly up over the meat, then roll enchilada closed from one side to the other and place in casserole dish. Repeat this action for all 8 enchiladas. Set the enchiladas in the oven to bake for 15 minutes. Sprinkle with shredded cheese and black olives, and set to bake for 5 more minutes. Allow enchiladas to cool for 6 minutes before serving. Mexican rice, refried beans, and guacamole make this meal a fiesta! Check out my recipe for Rachymommys Pot Roast.",

Fill the canner with water until it is half full and put it on medium high heat. 2. Fill the jars partially with water and place them on the rack in the canner for sterilization. 3. Bring the water to a boil. 4. Boil the jars for about 10 minutes. Note: Jars can also be placed in the dishwasher and run through the high heat cycle. Be sure to let it go through the rinse cycle to get rid of any soap! 5. Fill the canner about 1/2 full of water and start it heating (with the lid on). 6. Put the lids into the small pot of boiling water for at least several minutes. Method: Processing the Tomatoes 1. Wash tomatoes. 2. Cut shallow in non stem end to aid peeling. 3.

Fill jars with raw tomatoes, leaving 1/2 inch headspace. 5. Press tomatoes in the jars until spaces between them fill with juice. 6. Add salt to the jars. 1 teaspoon of salt per quart of tomatoes 1/2 teaspoon of salt per pint of tomatoes 7. Add lemon juice or citric acid to the jars. 2 tablespoons of bottled lemon juice or 1/2 teaspoon of citric acid per quart of tomatoes 1 tablespoon bottled lemon juice or 1/4 teaspoon citric acid per pint of tomatoes Note: Acid can be added directly to the jars before filling with product; in fact, this is recommended to be sure you get the acid in each and every jar. 8. Using a flat plastic or wood utensil, free trapped air bubbles by gently sliding it up and down around the inside edge. 9. Put the lids and rings on. Note: Just screw them on snugly, not too tight. If there is any tomato on the surface of the lip of the jar, wipe it off first with a clean dry cloth or paper towel. 10. Put the filled jars in the canner and keep them covered with at least 1 inch of water. 11. Process the jars in a boiling-water bath. 85 minutes for quarts. 85 minutes for pints. 12. When processing is complete, lift the jars out of the water and let them cool in a draft-free place.",

Turned up the heat and put in the ground beef, started breaking it up with spatula. Continued to brown the beef and break up with a little cookie-cutter type chopper with sharp, scalloped teeth (use whatever you prefer as a utensil. Brown to me is parts are actually a nice brown, not just stirring around until all the pink is gone; it helps with the flavor. When beef was browned to my satisfaction, put the onions back into the skillet with the browned, broken-up beef. Added the tomato paste, diced tomatoes and water, stirred on low heat. Add the flavor booster and did a taste test because it's salty, just right. To avoid over salting,I didn't use any salt except what I boiled the shells in until I added the booster (it's concentrated). Add the seasoned salt, seasoned pepper blend, parsley, Worcestershire sauce and cheese. If it's too thick, add a little more water; if too watery, cook it down while stirring, doesn't take long. Can be eaten right away, baked in oven, frozen, or made a day ahead. Add ground pepper to taste when served.",

It usually takes about 2 minutes and the butter will smell wonderfully nutty. Immediately take the pot off of the heat and let it cool. Meanwhile, start on the rest of the batter. In a large mixing bowl, whisk the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, cinnamon and salt together to aerate the dry ingredients. Separate the eggs into two separate bowls. In the bowl with the yolks, add the almond milk, banana extract and cooled brown butter and whisk them together. Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients and whisk it all together gently just until a batter forms. A few lumps are ok. Then get out a hand mixer and whip up the egg whites for a minute or so until they look like fluffy clouds. Use a spatula to gently fold the egg whites into the pancake batter. If possible, cover the bowl and let the batter rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Preheat a large electric griddle to 325 degrees F or heat a large griddle pan on the stove over medium high heat. Grease it lightly with a little butter. Ladle the batter in the desired sized portions onto the griddle and let the pancakes puff up and cook on the first side for about 4-5 minutes. While they cook on the first side, sprinkle the finely chopped banana and some chocolate chips into the pancakes. As they start to puff up, theyll just enrobe the goodies. Flip them over and allow them to cook completely for another 45 minutes on the other side. Repeat with the rest of the batter in batches until it is gone. Serve the pancakes with extra banana slices, chocolate chips, chopped walnuts and maple syrup on top.

        "For the filling: 1. Preheat oven to 400 F. Peel the squash, cut it in half lengthwise, remove the seeds then cut it into cubes. Spread it on a rimmed pan, drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast at 400 F for 25-30 minutes or until squash is fork tender. 2. Heat the oil in a saute pan over medium heat. Add onions and garlic and saute them until soft and translucent. 3. Place 2 cups of the squash in a food processor with the cooked garlic and onion mixture, the nutmeg and the mascarpone cheese. 4. Puree until totally smooth. 5. Season with salt and pepper to taste and set aside until you are ready to assemble the ravioli. For the truffle oil sauce: 1. Combine the vinegar and white wine in a saucepan on medium heat. Reduce until the liquid forms a light syrup. 2. Once it thickens, reduce the heat and add the cream. I often heat the cream first because I find that cream curdles less if you heat it first. I hate it when things curdle. 3. Decrease heat to low and whisk in butter, one cube at a time until well incorporated. You may not need the full amount. Start with 1/4 cup and then taste and see what you think. Do not allow it to boil. 4. Add lemon juice and truffle oil. Do not leave out the truffle oil. The oil is what makes this sauce. Keep sauce warm until ready to serve. For the ravioli dough: 1. Into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, add flour and salt and mix; then add 1 egg at a time and blend as you add each. Then add oil and mix until it forms a ball. Knead until smooth and then cover and let the dough rest for 30 minutes. 2. Cut dough in quarters and cover the rest so it doesnt dry out. Flour the counter and press the first section of dough flat to put it into the pasta machine. Put it into the machine on the widest setting. Do this 2 or 3 times then after that, turn the dial to the next setting getting thinner as your turn. The dial my machine starts at 1 and I go to 4 on the dial. 3. Once you have a thin sheet of pasta, cut or shape the pasta into whatever form you desire. For ravioli, read on ... 4. If you have a pasta maker, use it to make two strips of dough that are about 5 inches wide. Lay one piece down and drop tablespoon sized scoops of the squash filling evenly spaced down the length of the sheet of dough (about 2 inches apart) and also make two rows across the width of the sheet. Then place the other strip of pasta over top and press down around each spoonful to make a sealed pocket. Then cut into ravioli squares. 5. If you dont have a pasta maker, just roll the pasta by hand into at least a 10 inch wide rectangle and then cut into 2 strips that are 5 inches wide each and follow the directions above. 6. Cook the ravioli by boiling a pot of salted water. When water hits a boil, throw a bunch of ravioli in (dont crowd the pot) and cook for a few minutes until they float. Drain and assemble the dish. Eat and savor! For the garnish: 1. Heat 1/4 of the butter in a saute pan over medium-high heat. Add the prawns and cook for 1 to 2 minutes per side, or until they are an orange-pink color. Immediately remove them from the pan. 2. Melt the remaining butter in the same pan. Add the sage leaves and fry until crisp. For the assembly: As an appetizer: Assemble 3 or 4 ravioli on each plate, place one sage leaf on each ravioli and one prawn on top. Drizzle a spoon full of the sauce over each one. As a main course: Place a number of ravioli on each plate, sprinkle a few sage leaves and prawns on top. Drizzle the sauce over the whole works. You are going to love these! You will be so glad you made these at home, because you can just make yourself another plate.",

Cook on medium to low heat for about 5 minutes, trying to get as much of the garlic infused into the oil. Remove the skillet from the heat. Remove the garlic, and throw it away. Reserve the oil. Make sure you thinly slice your potatoes. This is great practice with your knife skills. Once all of your potatoes are sliced, add them to the cold water, making sure they are all submerged. Let them sit in the water for about 20 minutes. Drain, and place them on a large towel, making sure you pat them dry. Add the potatoes to a large bowl, adding in the reserved oil, salt, and herbes de provence. Toss the potatoes, making sure you evenly coat them with the seasonings. Spray a large sheet tray with cooking oil. Add the sliced potatoes to the sheet making sure not to overlap or crowd. Place in the preheated oven and cook until a nice golden brown, being careful not to overcook them as they will get bitter. These take about 2026 minutes in the oven. Quickly remove the potatoes from the pan, adding them to another bowl and toss with a pinch of salt. Serve warm or place them in a brown paper bag for later use. When I placed these on the table, the kids took a glance at them, as did my wife. As soon as they ate one, it was as though we had the best bag of chips poured out onto a plate and we all just dove in. Simple things make people happy. Enjoy.",

        "For the banana bundt cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Generously butter a 12-cup Bundt pan. (Dont place the pan on a baking sheet. You want the ovens heat to circulate through the inner tube of the pan.) In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. Set aside. Using a stand mixer or a hand mixer with a large bowl, beat the butter until creamy. Add the sugar and beat at medium speed until pale and fluffy. Beat in vanilla, then add the eggs one at a time, beating for about 1 minute after each egg goes in. Reduce the mixer speed to low and mix in the bananas. Finally, mix in half the dry ingredients (do not be alarmed if the mixture looks curdled! ), all the sour cream, and then the rest of the flour mixture. Set aside. For the strawberry filling: In a small bowl, stir together 1-1/2 cups of the banana bundt cake batter with the strawberry jam, strawberry gelatin and red food coloring. Set aside. To assemble the cake: Scrape 1/3 of the banana bundt cake batter into the prepared pan, leveling it out with a spatula. Then add all the strawberry filling, evening out the layer with the spatula. Add the remaining banana bundt cake batter to the pan. Rap the pan on the counter to remove any bubbles in the batter and smooth the top. Bake for about 65 minutes, or until a thin knife inserted deep into the center of the cake comes out clean. Check the cake after about 30 minutesif it is browning too quickly, cover it loosely with a foil tent. When done, transfer the cake to a rack to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before unmolding the cake onto the rack to cool completely. Once the cake is cooled, prepare the chocolate glaze. Place all glaze ingredients in a small saucepan and simmer over medium heat, stirring constantly until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Remove from heat and cool for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally until the glaze is thickened but still pourable. Stir until completely smooth and then drizzle over the cake. I prefer to wait a couple hours, until the glaze has set, to serve the cake. This cake keeps extremely well for a few days, covered on the counter.

        "Rinse oysters thoroughly in cold water to remove the sand and drain, reserving as much oyster liquor as possible. Also strain out sandy particles or pieces of shell that might be present in the liquor. Place dehydrated mushrooms in a bowl and cover them with boiling water and let stand for 30 minutes. (Since the dehydrated mushrooms can be a bit spendy, I just purchase a small package of mixed wild mushrooms that include porcinis). To remove any sand that might be present, strain liquid through a cheese cloth and reserve the liquid. Chop the rehydrated mushrooms finely. Melt 4 tablespoons butter in in a large soup pot over medium heat. Saute onion, celery, rehydrated mushrooms, thyme, and nutmeg until vegetables are soft and translucent. Stir in 1/4 cup flour until well incorporated and allow flour to brown slightly. (I probably use at least 1/2 teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg. Chef Sarah calls for a \"pinch. \"). Gradually add in the reserved mushroom liquid, fish stock, oyster juices, and sherry. (If you do not have fish stock, use bottled clam juice. But it is easy to make using fish heads, fish bone trimmings, onion, and celery. Although salmon heads can be used for some types of stock, I prefer to use heads from white fish, like cod or snapper.) Simmer soup base uncovered 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. While the soup is simmering, slice the button mushrooms and chop remaining fresh mushrooms. Then saute in 2 tablespoons of butter. Although Chef Sarah only uses button mushroom and oyster mushrooms, I prefer to add other types of fresh mushrooms. I have noted from other recipes that oyster mushrooms are usually a substitute for Hen of the Woods mushrooms, but the latter have such an intensely earthy flavor and an interesting texture. Also while soup is simmering prepare wild rice according to package directions. Once base has simmered long enough to get all the flavors married, add the light cream. Then puree with an immersion blender. (Chef Sarah also purees the oyster mushrooms in with the base, but I would rather leave them chopped with the other fresh mushrooms). Add in sauteed fresh mushrooms, 1 1/2 cups of prepared wild rice, and oysters. Heat thoroughly to blend the flavors and cook until the edges of the oysters curl slightly. Adjust flavors with salt, pepper, and additional sherry. Serve at once, garnished with chopped parsley or thyme leaves and a splash of sherry in each bowl. Note: To prepare according to cookbook recipe, use only oyster mushrooms and button mushrooms. Finely chop the oyster mushrooms, so they can be pureed in with the base. Then combine sliced button mushrooms, oysters, and wild rice and complete as above. Also recipe from cookbook uses cream sherry and heavy cream instead of light cream.",

You need 24 pieces total, so you may have to start with a bag. Each piece will need to be big enough to hold at least a half a slice of kiwi. Set the winning pieces on a platter. Scoop the marscapone cheese into a pastry bag fitted with a star tip. Pipe a small dollop of cheese onto each apple chip. Next, place a piece of the sliced kiwi on the chips. If a chip is very small, cut the kiwi slice in half first. Finally, top each chip with a little bit of basil. Now try not to eat them all before your guests see them. Better yet, serve immediately. A note on apple crisps: These are freeze dried sliced apples. Dried apples are usually chewy, but freeze dried apples are light, crispy, and have a texture more similar to a thick potato chip or a cracker. They are susceptible to moisture, however, and will become soggy if they sit too long with cheese or other ingredients on top of them.

        "To make the crepes, start by beating the eggs, then stir in the milk. When well-combined, add the flour bit by bit, stirring all the time to avoid lumps. When all the flour has been incorporated, add the sugar and oil and mix well. The batter now is ready. To make the crepes, butter the surface of the pan or in this case a special crepe pan (where you can make six at a time). Spoon some of the batter on the pan, swirl around just enough to cover it and cook 12 minutes on each side. Repeat with the rest of the batter. To make the caramel, melt the sugar in a saucepan on low-medium heat. Be sure to use a pan that lets you see the colour of the sugar as it melts, otherwise you can easily burn it and thats the point of no return. When the sugar starts to melt (you will first see it on the sides) you can start pushing it a bit towards the centre to prevent it from burning, stirring it occasionally. When the sugar has melted and has a nice dark amber colour, take it off the heat and stir in the butter (careful here as it tends to splash). Add a splash of Calvados and finally stir in the cream. Transfer the caramel to a jar/container leave it to cool in the room temperature, then place it in the fridge till needed. To make the jam, grate the zest of the oranges and squeeze the juice. Peel and core the apples, then cut into small cubes of equal size. Mix all the ingredients (apples, zest, juice and sugar) in a small saucepan and simmer for about 15 minutes till the apples are soft, stirring occasionally. Check if you are happy with the sweetness, then pass through a fine sieve and store in an airtight jar. You can prepare the caramel and jam a few days in advance and keep them in the fridge. To serve, layer the crepes with the apple-orange jam and top with the wonderful salty caramel. You can also garnish with some orange peel.",

Once the scales have been removed, cut around the head where there is a shallow depression. Leave the skin on the other side intact, so that the head is still attached by that skin. This is how it looks from the side. Hold onto the head that was cut in Step 4, push out the guts, and peel off the skin in one go.

The real British breakfast sausage is what you want. Put oven on 350 deg F/180 deg Celsius. Put the pork sausage meat in a bowl, then add the rest of the ingredients except the bacon. Mix well. Using a medium bread tin or terrine, grease lightly, then line it with the bacon (the streaky type are the strips with a fair amount of fat marbling, more so than shoulder bacon). Spoon in the meat mixture, pressing in lightly, and smooth with the back of a spoon. If there are any flaps of bacon visible, fold over the terrine. Bake for 1 hour plus, until slightly risen and firm. Let it cool to warm. Don't pour off fats and liquid now, as much will be reabsorbed into the terrine. You can discard extra fat when you unmold it later. (You could also bake it more carefully, by putting the terrine in a larger dish, and filling the larger dish with hot water, to come halfway up the terrine). Using a cleaned clay brick, wrap it in 2 thicknesses of foil and put on the terrine to weigh it down. When cold, keep in fridge overnight. To serve, unmold and garnish to taste, and serve with mustard or sauce of your choice. Can be heated in the oven, and served with veggies and a carb, for the main meal.",

Heat a couple of tablespoons olive oil in a large pan (Note: you may have to add extra during cooking as the breadcrumb mixture absorbs quite a lot.) Add chicken and cook until browned and crisp on both sides and cooked all the way through. It is hard to give an exact time per side as breasts vary in thickness, therefore cooking times will vary. If you think that the chicken is not cooked all the way through, but the outside will get too crispy if left on, just turn the heat down and continue cooking until done turning chicken occasionally. Cream Sauce. Heat butter in a pan, add onion and garlic, cook until soft. Add wine and saffron, simmer uncovered a few minutes to reduce slightly.

        "PREPARATION: Make sure your rice is already cooking (or cooked and set to warm in an electric rice cooker). Prep all of your fruits, juices, and seasonings before you begin and have them handy near the stove as this will cook quickly. Whisk together the vinegar with the cornstarch until smooth and set near stove- leave whisk nearby so you can quickly rewhisk if it settles before adding. Also, make sure your shrimp is peeled,& deveined and ready to go by the stove (If using raw or precooked frozen shrimp,thaw by running under cold water in a mesh strainer,tossing them with your clean hands to keep them from sticking together, until thawed- drain well and set in a bowl near the stove.) COOKING: Heat oil in a large skillet on medium high heat- you only need enough oil to keep your ingredients from sticking. Add shrimp and stir fry until shrimp turns pink and is opaque- no more than 5 minutes from raw, or just 1 minute for precooked shrimp. Remove from pan using a slotted spoon and set aside. Add orange juice, lime juice, sugar,pineapple, papaya, and mango to the pan and stir to coat. Quickly rewhisk the cornstarch mixture and add to the pan- stirring constantly. Bring to a boil and cook for about 1 minute, until sauce thickens slightly, stirring constantly. Return shrimp to the pan and cook 1 minute or until heated through, stirring constantly. Immediately remove from the heat. Serve over hot cooked rice and garnish if desired with a sprinkling of fresh herbs. TIP: To make pretty rice mounds, press the hot rice into a 1 cup measuring scoop or a small custard cup- place plate on top and flip over- when you remove the mold, a nice rounded dome of rice will be on the plate.",

Meanwhile, combine the flours, salt, and lard in a bowl and work in the fat with your hands until broken up into very small pieces. When the yeast is foamy, fit the mixer with a dough hook attachment and gradually add the flour on low speed until its all incorporated. Scrape the sides down between additions. When the dough comes together, turn it onto a floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 5-10 minutes, adding more flour if necessary. Alternatively, you can let the machine do the work. Coat a large bowl with the Olive Oil, then put the dough in, turning once to coat both sides. Cover loosely with a clean dry towel, or plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1-1/2 hours. Punch the dough down and shape into a flat round about 9 inches across (it will expand to about 10&#8243;.) Place the dough on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Sprinkle the top with sesame seeds, about 2-3 Tbsp should do it, then press them lightly into the dough. Loosely cover the loaf and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. When the dough has risen, remove the cover, gently brush with the egg wash then gently place into a preheated 425 degree F oven for 10 minutes.

Combine the melted butter and olive oil in a pyrex measuring cup or microwave-safe bowl, heat very slightly at 50 percent power and stir together. Place 8 sheets of phyllo dough on your work surface. Cover with a dish towel and place another, damp dish towel on top of the first towel. Each time you take a piece of phyllo from the pile, replace the towels so that the phyllo doesnt dry out. Place a sheet of parchment on your work surface horizontally, with the long edge close to you. Take a sheet of phyllo from the pile and lay it on the parchment. Brush the first sheet of phyllo lightly with the butter and olive oil mixture and top with the next sheet. Continue to layer all eight sheets, brushing each one before topping with the next one. Brush the top sheet of phyllo dough with the butter and olive oil mixture. Spread the remaining wild rice over the surface, leaving a 3-inch margin at the bottom and a 2 1/2 inch margin at the top and on the sides. Spread the mushroom mixture over the rice. Fold the bottom edge of the phyllo up over the filling, then fold the ends over and roll up like a burrito. Using the parchment paper to help you lift the strudel, place both the parchment paper and the strudel on a baking sheet with the seam side down. Brush with butter and olive oil and make 3 or 4 slits on the diagonal along the length of the strudel. Place the strudel in the oven and bake 20 minutes.

Boil peppers for 7-9 min. Immediately remove and place in a bowl of ice water. Brown ground beef with chopped pepper tops and drain very well. Separate cooked beef mixture in half and place in two bowls. (About 1 1/2 c per bowl) Cook chopped cauliflower until tender(I used the same water I boiled peppers in) Set aside Into one bowl of beef mixture add 2 cups of prepared Rice a Roni. (Youll have some left over) In the other bowl, add 2 cups of the cooked cauliflower. Combine sauce, sugar, seasoning, garlic, salt and pepper. Reserve 1/2 c for pepper topping. Add 3/4 c of sauce mixture to each bowl of beef mixture. Mix well. Add 3/4 c of parmesan to each bowl of meat mixture. Drain peppers well and place in a sprayed baking dish large enough to fit all 6 peppers(I used a 9x6) Fill 3 peppers with the beef and rice mixture. Fill 3 peppers with beef and cauliflower mixture. Top each pepper with a spoonful of the reserved 1/2 cup of sauce. Tightly place foil over peppers and cook at 350 for 50-60 min. Add a healing tbsp of mozzarella to each pepper and return to oven. The pepper on the left is rice. The pepper on the right is cauliflower. Gracie approves!! !",

In a separate large bowl lined with some extra oil, place dough mixture, covering with a moist towel and let sit in a dark warm place for approximately one hour. Dough should double in size. While the dough is rising, prepare chicken breast on the grill until just cooked. Chop into small bite size pieces and set aside. Preheat oven to 500 degrees F. When dough has risen, cut in half. Use the second half for another pizza, such as my Southwestern BBQ Chicken and Veggie. Spread dough onto a nonstick pan. With spatula evenly spread pesto over dough.

        "Add the cashew flour (see note below), coconut sugar and potato starch into a medium sized bowl and mix well. Stir in the egg white with a fork, then add cream 1 tablespoon at a time, until it becomes a crumbly mixture that you can form into a ball. Add just enough cream to form the ball. If youre having trouble getting your dough to stick together, add extra. Use your fingers to press about 2 tablespoons of dough into the bottoms and part way up the sides of each cup in two 12-count greased standard size muffin tins or similar size tartlet tins. The recipe should make about 20-24 tartlets, so make sure not to make each crust too thick. Also make sure to tightly pack the crust into the tins, or it will crumble when you try to take it out! Try pressing the bottom of a smooth cup in there to make them smooth. Heat the oven to 400 F. Place the dates in a food processor and process until they form a paste. Add the chopped apples to your food processor (on top of the date paste), and squeeze the lemon juice on top. Add all of the other filling ingredients. Pulse your mixture in the food processor until the apples are in small chunks. Note that the mixture shouldnt be too wet. Add more potato starch if you need to. Feel free to be creative with the recipe! Scoop a couple tablespoons of the apple mixture into your prepared muffin/tartlet tins on top of the crust youve pressed in there. Bake for about 15 minutes, or until the edges of the crust start to turn brown. Serve with cashew cream or dairy-free whipped cream. You will probably have extra filling, but my kids took care of that problem quickly, eating it straight out of the food processor (obviously the blades were removed). Enjoy! Notes: 1. If you have a hard time finding affordable cashew flour it is really easy to make! Just pulse raw cashews in your food processor, until theyre a fine consistency. I do not recommend almond flour for pie crusts, because I dont think it tastes very good in this context. It took about 10 seconds to crush the cashews in my food processor. 2. Since you will be running them through the food processor and making small chunks, the skin on the apples wont make it too tough to chew after theyre baked. Leaving the skins on lowers the Glycemic Index (GI) number of the dish by adding healthy fiber. 3. You can add dried cranberries and pecans into the filling for extra flavor. 4. Recipe makes 20-24 tartlets.",

White Mix: 1 cup flour 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1 dash allspice 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda Black Mix: 1/2 cup flour 1/2 cup cocoa 1/4 teaspoon espresso powder 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda Combine the rest of the ingredients in a third bowl: the zucchini, beaten eggs, oil, juice, sugar, vanilla, and chocolate. Split the liquid batter between the two dry bowls and mix each bowl gently until completely combined. Butter a bundt pan. To make the swirls, dump alternating cupfuls of white and black batter into the bundt pan. I did about 4-5 alternating colors. Once youve distributed all the batter take a spatula and run it through the middle of the batter around the pan once. This will produce the swirl pattern. (For pictures, see related blog post) Bake for 40-55 minutes. Cake is done once cracks are dry and toothpick comes out clean. If you are unsure, leave it in for another few minutes (the toothpick will be dry before the cake is done). The cake is very moist, but you dont want it to be undercooked. Let cake cool slightly before removing from pan. Serve with butter! You may want to have a witness there when you take your first bite because, trust me, it will be hard to restrain yourself. An alternative name for this cake is the 24 Hour Cake because it only lasts that long, or less.

Transfer them to a saucepan and mix with the butter and sugar. Cook the mixture down over medium heat until the apples are translucent, then leave to cool. While cooling, mix in the cinnamon and brandy. Take 2/3 of the pastry and roll it out so that it covers the bottom of the pie dish. The pastry should be approx. 3 mm thick. Place it into the pie dish and let the edges hang over the sides. Then use a rolling pin to cut off the excess. Prick several holes in the bottom sheet of pastry with a fork. Take the rest of the pastry and slice it into 2 cm wide strips to make the border of the pie. Then cut the remaining pastry into thinner strips to top the pie with. Fill the pie with the apples from Step 7. Place the thinner strips of pastry on top of the apples in a lattice pattern. Then place the wider strips around the edge of pie to create the border. Crimp down the pastry with a fork and brush over an egg glaze.

        "Preheat oven to 350 F. Line an 8x8 baking dish with foil, allowing some foil to overhang the edges. (This makes it easier to take the bars out and cut them neatly at the end.) Lightly butter the foil and set the dish aside. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat, and continue to cook until it is nutty and brown, about 5-6 minutes. Watch carefully, as it can go from fantastic and yummy browned butter to icky burnt butter very quickly. Remove it from the heat and allow to cool slightly. In a large mixing bowl, combine the brown sugar and the sugar, then whisk in the browned butter. Whisk in the eggs and the vanilla. Set aside. Combine the flour, salt and baking soda in a medium bowl, then add to the sugar/butter/egg mixture and stir with a wooden spoon or spatula to combine. Divide the batter in half, and transfer half to the bowl that you mixed up the flour in. Add the cocoa powder and the chocolate chips to one of the bowls, and stir well to combine. Spread the chocolate batter into the bottom of the prepared pan, pressing gently to form an even layer. If you are using nuts, sprinkle them on top of the chocolate layer, then spread the plain batter on top of that, smoothing gently. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool completely (the bars may sink a bit in the middle as they cool ... no worries!). Then lift bars out of the pan using the foil edges, cut into small squares, and serve. NOTE: Adapted from a recipe posted on the always drool-inducing Bake or Break blog.",
