Divide the dough into two balls, wrap them, and chill them in the fridge for a minimum of 1 hour. Mix the sliced apples with the cinnamon, sugar, and lemon juice, reserving a little sugar and cinnamon. Mix well. On a lightly floured surface, roll out one ball of pastry and use it to line a deep 10-inch pie dish. Bake the pastry blind (see note on baking blind). When the pie shell has cooled, fill it with the apples, piling them higher in the center. Roll out the other pastry ball thinly and gently lay it on top. Press the edges together, trim off any excess pastry, then mark the edges with a fork and prick the top of the pie several times. Mix the reserved cinnamon and sugar together, and sprinkle the mixture on top of the pie. Bake at 375 F for 35-40 minutes, until the topping is golden brown and the apples have cooked. Note: Baking Blind: Baking blind, which partially cooks the pie shell, will ensure that it stays crisp under a liquid filling. Cover the pastry, including the rim, with aluminum foil to prevent it from rising. Weigh it down with baking beans (dried lima or butter beans are perfect). Bake it in a preheated oven at 400 F for 10-12 minutes (slightly less time if you are making small individual pie shells).

Roll out the second ball and place into a standard size pie plate, crimping the edges to form the bottom dough. Chill both sections of dough for at least 2 hours or overnight.

Stir to combine and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature to a simmer, add the apples, and let them cook for about 5 to 10 minutes, or until the apples soften a bit, stirring occasionally. In a small saucepan over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons of the sauce from the apple pan (if some tiny apple pieces come along too its no big deal), plus the remaining tablespoon of butter, and allow the butter to melt. Stir mixture to combine, remove from heat and set aside. Fill the chilled pie crust with the apple mixture. Roll out the top pie crust and either add the whole crust and crimp the edges together, or by prepare a lattice top. See notes for lattice crust preparation instructions. Evenly spread/brush the butter glaze on the top pie crust. Bake for about 45-50 minutes or until golden brown. When baked, take pie out of the oven and allow to cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing and serving. This pie is best enjoyed with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream. Notes: 1. Crust from Epicurious. 2. If youd like, you could use your own double recipe for a 9-inch pie crust or go ahead and use two prepared 9-inch pie crusts.

In a large (6- or 8-quart) pot, combine the strawberries, drained rhubarb, sugar, and butter if using and bring to a full rolling boil over high heat. Add the pectin and bring back to a boil. Boil for one minute and then remove from the heat. Skim off any foam (if you used the butter, there may not be any foam) and pour into your prepared jars leaving 1/8 inch headspace. Wipe jar rims and threads, cover with two piece lids, screw bands on and boil in a canner for 10 minutes. Remove jars from canner and allow to sit overnight.

Roast the cherry tomatoes by placing them cut side down on a pan on the stove over medium-high heat. Cook for a few minutes. Flip them over and cook for another few minutes. Now place the cover of a pot over the cherry tomatoes in the pan. Reduce heat to low and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. What you're doing is steaming and finishing cooking the tomatoes. Alternately, you can put them in the microwave for 30 seconds. You won't get the roasted flavor, but it's good in a pinch. Assemble: Sprinkle mozzarella on top of naan. Bubble side up. Top with cherry tomatoes and basil. Sprinkle with Italian seasoning Place on dry pan over medium-high heat. Cook for 2 minutes then cover with a pot cover to melt cheese. Enjoy! !

While the sausages are browning, heat a large stock pot of water over high heat, covered. While waiting for the water to boil, make an ice bath using another large stock pot. Fill with about 4 cups of ice, and fill vessel with water until water comes to the top of the ice. Set aside. When the water starts boiling, add in green beans and cook for 5 minutes, until the vegetables are bright green and still have some crunch to them. Immediately put in the ice bath to stop cooking, tossing with a spoon to make sure everybody is chillin out. I like to wait until all ice is melted. Drain and set aside. When sausages have finished cooking, remove to a plate. Combine lemon juice, orange juice, orange zest, tamari, garlic, and beer in a small bowl. Add to skillet that contained the sausage. Reduce over medium heat, until sauce is thick and nearly all evaporated, about 35 minutes. The bubbles will appear thick and wont break right away. Once the sausage is cool enough to handle, slice on the bias into rounds. Add green beans and sausage to skillet containing reduced sauce, and continually toss until green beans are coated with sauce and are just heated through.

Add eggs, vanilla and peppermint extracts, scraping down the sides as necessary, and mix until well incorporated. Place flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt, if using, into a medium-sized bowl and stir briefly to combine. Add the flour into the egg mixture and mix on low until it begins to incorporate, then stop mixing and add the milk. Mix on low-medium speed until the batter is smooth and well combined. Add in the dark chocolate chips and fold in with a wooden spoon or spatula. Divide the batter between each cupcake liner, filling each one 3/4 full. Place in the oven for 2025 minutes, until risen and an inserted skewer into the centre comes out clean. Transfer to a wire rack as soon as possible to stop the liners getting greasy and peeling away from the cakes. Leave to cool completely, before making the frosting. For the frosting, place butter into a large bowl, or the bowl of your stand mixer and beat until light and fluffy. Add icing sugar, peppermint extract and salt in and mix on low until it begins to combine. Once it starts to combine and theres no risk of the icing dust cloud, turn the speed up to medium-high and beat until well combined. Add milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until you have desired consistency. You want it to hold its shape, but be smooth in texture. It needs to be soft enough to pipe, but thick enough to hold the shape you pipe. Half fill a piping bag fitted with an open star nozzle and pipe a swirl onto each cooled cupcake.

        "Preheat oven to 350. Roll out your bottom pie crust. Place the bottom pie crust in a 9-inch deep dish pie pan. You could also use a cake pan for this. Do not crimp sides yet. Saute diced onion in olive oil until soft and golden, about 5 minutes. Let cool. In a large bowl, beat 6 eggs. Add the ricotta and whisk until lumps are gone. Add prosciutto, provolone, Grana Padano and mozzarella cheese. Add cooked onion and black pepper to taste. Sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese on the bottom pie crust. Pour egg/cheese mixture into your pie crust. Roll out top pie crust and place over pie. Fold the overhang of the top crust over and tuck it behind the edges of the bottom crust. Crimp them together. Beat your remaining 1 egg with 1 teaspoon of water. Brush over top and edges of pie. Cut a slit in pie to vent. Bake 40-50 minutes until top starts to look golden brown. When done, let the pie rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. This is important so it wont ooze all over when you cut it! **Do not be tempted to add any salt. You get plenty of salt from the cheeses and prosciutto. Feel free to substitute a different combo of Italian cheeses or meats.",

Very lightly pat down to form a patty. Not too much. Set aside and allow the meat to sit. Heat your charcoal or gas grill to medium heat. While the grill is heating prepare the cheese sauce. Start by placing a saucepan on the stove on medium heat. Add the butter. Once the butter has melted, add the flour and whisk to remove any lumps. Continue to mix/whisk the flour and butter mixture for about 2 minutes. This will help cook the flour. Add in the crushed garlic. Allow to saute for 30 seconds. Add the sake wine and half-and-half. Stir. Once it has started to thicken, add the paprika and black pepper. Stir. Start adding in the cheeses a little at a time, constantly stirring until the cheese has melted. Once all the cheese has been added and melted, add in the chives and turn off the heat. Set aside until ready to use. Place your burgers on the grill. If you are using a charcoal grill place the burgers on the outside ring of the heat as it will flame up when the fat melts off the meat. Cook until the burgers are done to your liking.

I used the small arugula as my lettuce, the bitterness gives it an even balance with the rich cheese sauce. 3.

Combine the flour and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook and mix well. With the mixer on low, add the yeast mixture and oil, mixing well. Continue to mix, gradually increasing the mixer speed to medium-high, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and give it a few turns by hand to finish kneading it; it will still be slightly sticky. Alternatively, combine the flour and salt in a large bowl and whisk together. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add the yeast mixture and oil. Using a wooden spoon, stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until the mixture is too stiff to stir, then mix with your hands in the bowl until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn the dough out onto the lightly floured work surface and knead, adding only as much flour as necessary to prevent sticking, until smooth elastic, and only slightly sticky. Transfer the dough to a large oiled bowl, turning to coat, cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until doubled in size. Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a well-floured work surface. Divide it into 8 pieces (about 4 ounces each) and shape each one into a ball. Cover with a tea towel and let stand for 15 minutes before stretching the dough. Or, for easier handling, transfer the balls to a floured baking sheet and refrigerate until cold. Dust a large work surface with a mixture of flour and semolina. If the dough has been refrigerated, transfer one ball to work surface and let stand just until still cool but not cold ( about 60F if tested with an instant-read thermometer). Meanwhile, preheat the griddle pan over medium heat until very hot, about 5 minutes (at the restaurant, we use a digital infrared thermometer to gauge the temperature of the griddle, which, ideally, should be 375F). Using your hands, begin to press and stretch the dough into a 9- to 10- inch round, adding only enough additional flour and semolina to the work surface to keep the dough from sticking; using one hand as a guide, slope a slightly thicker rim all around the circle of dough. Work quickly, and be careful not to overwork the dough; if it resists or shrinks back as you shape it, let it rest briefly before proceeding. (If you prefer, you can roll out the dough with a rolling pin. Lightly flour the work surface and the rolling pin; sprinkle the rolling pin with more flour as necessary to prevent sticking.) Carefully place the dough round on the pre-heated griddle pan and cook until barely tan on the first side and browned in a few spots, 2 to 3 minutes. As the crust cooks, if you see any parts that remain undercooked, especially any thicker parts, simply press them against the pan so they cook a bit more; once the dough has set, you can move the crust around as necessary for more even cooking. Flip the crust over and cook until the second side is completely dry, about 1 minute longer. Transfer the crust to a wire rack or baking sheet, brushing off any excess flour, and allow to cool. Repeat with the remaining dough. (The parbaked crusts can be refrigerated overnight or frozen, well wrapped, for up to 2 weeks. Sometimes when you go through the effort of preparing all these steps, it might be work making more than you want to eat and then, depending on the toppings, freezing the extra finished pizzas. Occasionally I'll come home on a Sunday night and reheat a frozen pizza I made on Friday in the toaster ovena great snack in less than 10 minutes, with absolutely no effort.) We recommend making only one pizza at a time and serving each one as soon as it is done. If you need to make a lot for a large party, cook several of them once (slightly undercook them) and then reheat them in a warm oven before serving. Place the parbaked pizza crust on a pizza peel or baking sheet. Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the crust, leaving a 1/2 inch border all around, and top with any remaining ingredients as specified in the individual recipe. (Do not put the sauce and any other ingredients on the pizza crust until ready to broil it, or the crust may become soggy.) Slide the pizza under the broiler, about 4 inches from the heat source, and broil for 7 or 8 minutes (or as otherwise noted in the individual recipe), until the topping ingredients are heated and/or cooked through and crust is charred and blistered in spots. Watch closely so that the ingredients don't burn, and move the pizza around or lower the broiler rack if necessary. (Sometimes during this stage, depending on the topping, the bottom may start to become soggy; if that happens, you can simply slip the pizza back onto the griddle momentarily to recrisp the crust.) And, if you prefer more coloras we do!move the pizza closer to the heat source at the very end. Finish the pizza with any remaining ingredients, as described in the individual recipe, and cut into slices with a pizza wheel, kitchen shears, or a very sharp knife. Serve hot.",

Depending on the size of the egg you may need to adjust. Try the sauce and if it's too thick, add in water a little at a time. If it's too thin, add in flour a little at a time, until it reaches your desired consistency. Make layers of bite-sized pieces of pork offcuts. Season by sprinkling some salt and pepper on top. Next, holding the pork with chopsticks, coat it with the mixture from Step 1, then coat with the panko. Deep fry them in some preheated frying oil. Once they have cooled, put them in a freezer bag and then put them in the freezer. When you are putting them in a bento, simply heat them up in a microwave (If you cut them, they are easier to eat).

        "Start by preparing your blueberry topping, as it can simmer while making the pancake batter. In a small saucepan over low heat, add the frozen blueberries and honey or agave nectar and cover with a lid. If you are using fresh blueberries, add about a tablespoon of water. After about 3 minutes, check on the blueberriesonce juices begin to seep out, add the cinnamon and stir well. Cover again and continue to heat blueberries for about 10 to 15 minutes, checking occasionally. The topping is ready when the juices formed are syrupy and the blueberries are plump and hot. If youre looking for thick syrup, simply mash the blueberries with a fork while they are cooking in the saucepan. This time, I kept the blueberries whole. Once ready, remove from heat and leave the cover on to keep warm. While blueberries are on the stove, prepare pancake batter. In a mixing bowl, combine all wet ingredients and beat together. Add the coconut flour, baking powder and salt and continue to mix until all clumps are smoothed out and youre left with a very thick batter. If you are using a mixer, you might need to scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to get the coconut flour fully integrated. Allow batter to sit for about 5 minutes. Heat a large skillet on medium-low. Once warm, spread a dollop of butter evenly over the skillet. Using a spoon or rubber spatula, portion out about 1/3 of the batter and shape it into a pancake on the skillet. Coconut flour pancakes need to be manipulated more than the standard all-purpose flour pancakes, as coconut flour tends to hold its shape. (Note: If your pancakes begin to melt around the edges, it is because there is not enough coconut flour in your batch. Add more coconut flour a teaspoon at a time until the batter stays together on the skillet.) Repeat this step for the remaining 2/3 of the batter (this recipe makes 3 medium-sized pancakes), giving each pancake plenty of space for flipping. Allow pancakes to sit on the skillet for about 7 to 10 minutes (yup, thats how long these bad boys need before flipping). Carefully work a large spatula under each pancake and gently flip (it is easy to break coconut pancakes, so the flipping process is the most difficult part about this recipe). Allow the pancakes to cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes then remove from heat. Top pancakes with the blueberry topping and confectioners sugar (you know, to make them pretty). If you are looking for more sweetness, drizzle agave nectar, honey or pure maple syrup over the tops of the cakes.",

Oysters can be kept in a bowl draped with a damp towel, but they should be arranged carefully so they lie flat. Otherwise their briny liquid may drain out. Stored properly they should remain alive for 5 to 7 days, but know that freshness deteriorates with each day. Oysters still in the shell are best eaten soon after they arrive. An oyster that doesn't close when you press on its shell is dead and must be discarded. Shucked oysters and their juices should be wrapped airtight and can be stored under refrigeration for 4 to 5 days or frozen for up to 2 months.Do not store oysters where they could freeze, or where temperatures will fluctuate widely or reach over 40 F.

Season the bass with salt and pepper and add to the skillet, skin side down. Cook over moderately high heat until the skin is browned and crisp, about 4 minutes. Turn the fillets, transfer the skillet to the upper third of the oven and roast for about 4 minutes, until the fish is just white throughout. Transfer the bass to plates, season lightly with paprika and garnish with the small thyme springs. Spoon the brussels sprouts alongside and serve right away with the garlic aioli.",

With mixer still running, add egg yolks one at a time. Stop mixer and scrape bowl with a rubber spatula. Add flour and 1 cup cocoa, and resume mixing at low speed until the mixture is crumbly and uniformly blended. Scrape the bowl and knead the dough lightly to form a smooth ball. Transfer to a work surface and flatten into a disk. The dough may be rolled right away or wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to a week; bring to room temperature before rolling. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly sift some cocoa powder onto a work surface, and roll the dough to .125-inch thickness. Slide a metal spatula under the dough to prevent it from sticking. Using a 2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out cookies and transfer to an ungreased baking sheet. The cookies will not spread during baking so may be placed close together. Knead and reroll the dough scraps to make more cookies. To add texture to the cookies, place any remaining dough in a mixing bowl. Mix with enough hot water until the dough has thinned into a paste. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a very small tip, or a heavy duty Ziploc bag with a tiny hole poked in the corner. Pipe a design on each cookie; a tight cornelli lace design gives the impression of an Oreo. Bake the cookies until firm, about 12 minutes. Remove from heat and cool completely on a rack. For the filling: Using a mixer, cream together shortening or butter, confectioners sugar, vanilla and salt. Beat on medium speed for 5 minutes, scraping the bowl periodically. The long mixing time smoothes, whitens and aerates the filling. For assembly: Using a pastry bag fitted with a plain tip or a spoon, place 1 teaspoon (or more if desired) of filling directly onto the center of the undersides of half the cookies. To finish, top with remaining wafers and press down with your fingers, applying very even pressure so the filling will spread uniformly across the cookie.

Using a hand blender (also called an immersion blender or stick blender) begin to puree the cauliflower. I prefer to blend it about halfway, leaving small chunks of cauliflower throughout the soup for texture but its up to you. You can use a regular blender here if youd prefer. Scoop about half of the cauliflower out with a cup of broth and puree. Be careful and leave plenty of room in the blender for the mixture to expand. It will be very hot. Put the soup back into the pot if you used a regular blender. 4. Add the rice and simmer until the rice is soft and tender, according to package instructions. 5. At this point I used my hand blender again but only gave it a few pulses. I didnt want the rice to become completely pureed, just enough to blend in with the cauliflower. 6.

Spray a mini doughnut pan with nonstick cooking spray and fill each cavity about 2/3 full. Note that if you fill them more, the doughnuts will rise above the pan and look more like mini muffins than doughnuts. Bake in a preheated 375 degrees F oven for 10-11 minutes. The doughnuts will not be very brown but they should be springy to the touch. Allow them to cool in the pan for about 5 minutes before turning them out. While theyre baking, make the glaze by combining the melted butter, milk, powdered sugar and remaining lemon zest in a bowl. Whisk until smooth. When the doughnuts have cooled, dip each one about halfway into the glaze and place on a rack or plate to set. Sprinkle with baking decorations, if desired. Makes 24 mini doughnuts.",

Place them in a single layer on pan and place under the preheated broiler or on a grill. (If using an outdoor grill there is no need for a pan, just place them directly on grill rack). Watch them closely and turn only when they have turned black on one side. If you think you have burned them you are probably doing it right! Blacken the remaining side and remove from heat source. Using a pair of tongs transfer the blackened peppers or chiles to a paper or plastic bag (you could even use a pot with a tight fitting lid) and close bag well so condensation can build. You could also just lay a clean kitchen towel over the peppers or chiles and let the condensation work. Once they are cool to the touch, simply peel off the blackened skin and remove the stem and seeds and membrane inside. You can use a paper towel to get them cleaner but the small charred pieces add to the flavor in your dishes. Do NOT rinse with water for any reason! Now you can use them immediately, keep in the refrigerator for a few days or freeze them! I like to place them back on the pan in a single layer and freeze them that way,. Then transfer them to a zipper type bag and remove as much air as you can. Now you have individually frozen peppers or chiles and can remove just one or two as needed! If using hot peppers or chiles remember freezing them can increase their spiciness a little! That can be a good thing! NOTE: You can use this method for any type of pepper or chile just be careful to keep them separate for storing and using. I would also keep them from touching during the process to avoid transfer of spiciness to otherwise sweet peppers. Maybe roast together in a pan but let them \"steam\" in separate bags. Enjoy!

While stirring the noodles so they don't stick, cook for 1 minute on medium heat. Stop the heat and cover with a lid.

(Differing from the other pasta dishes in the one frying pan pasta series, don't evaporate the water here). Add the spinach and the ingredients and reheat on medium heat. Once the spinach has cooked through, it's finished. Make sure to stop the heat before the simmering causes the milk to form a film. Add salt and pepper to taste and it's done. Note: The oil from the butter and the bacon help to prevent the noodles from sticking. If you don't use these two, then add about 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil at Step 3.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spray your hands will cooking spray then roll the filling into small balls. Place on the parchment paper. These are rich little buggers so dont make them too large. 4. Place uncovered in the freezer for 1 hour. 5. Just before your truffles come out of the freezer, melt the chocolate. Place the chocolate chips in a stainless steel or glass bowl and place over a pot of gently boiling water. Stir constantly until melted. 6. Use a fork to dip the truffles in the chocolate and tap the fork on the side of the bowl to get rid of any extra chocolate. Use a toothpick to help remove the truffle from the fork and place back on the parchment paper (a little trick I learned from the Pioneer Woman). 7. After each truffle is made, go ahead and sprinkle on (or roll inwell, maybe not the salt) your desired topping before the chocolate dries. Optional toppings include the sea salt, coconut, or chopped walnuts. Surprisingly, my favorite topping was the sea salt because it really seemed to balance out the sweetness of the chocolate.

        "To prepare cake, preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and line an 8-inch square cake pan. In a large bowl, sift flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Mix well. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix eggs and sugar until well combined. Gradually add oil and vanilla, mix until just blended. With the mixer on low, slowly add half the flour mixture; mix until just blended. Add buttermilk, mix until just blended. Slowly add remaining flour mixture, scraping down sides of the bowl with a spatula, as necessary, until just blended. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Transfer pan to oven and bake for 1820 minutes. Let cake cool in pan for 15 minutes. Then invert it onto a greased rack. Let cool completely. To prepare buttercream, beat butter for a few minutes in a standing mixer with the paddle attachment on medium speed. Add powdered sugar and turn your mixer on low, beat until the sugar incorporates with the butter. Add vanilla and heavy cream, beat on medium speed for another 3 minutes, or until buttercream becomes light and fluffy. To assemble cake pops, prepare two cookie sheets lined with parchment paper. Break the cooled cake into a few big trunks by hand, place them into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on medium speed until the big pieces turn into crumbs. Add frosting gradually into the cake crumbs and blend until the mixture becomes a dough, about 1 to 1 1/2 cups of frosting. Use a small cookie scoop, roll dough into evenly-sized balls. Shape the balls into cone shape, and place them on the prepared cookie sheets. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Melt small amount of white Candy Melts in the microwave gradually, 10-second intervals and stirring in between. Dip one end of a lollipop stick in the melted candy and insert into the cake pop. Repeat until you are done. Refrigerate again for 15 minutes. Remove the cake pops from the refrigerator. Melt all the white candy melts in the microwave. Dip each cake pop in the candy melts and gently tap off excess. Place cake pop onto a piece of wax paper. Let it dry completely. Repeat with the remaining cake pops. Place the red candy melts in a microwavable Ziploc bag. Microwave on high for 2030 seconds to completely melt the candy melts. Push the melted candy toward one corner of the bag. With a pair of scissors, snip off a very small opening, and start piping the desired patterns to decorate the Christmas trees. Repeat with remaining colors.",

        "Add everything in the Spaghetti Sauce Section and simmer for about an hour +. Seasonings not pictured alongside canned goods below. Authors Note: Your sauce very well may have a metallic or a heavy acidic taste to it due to the high volume of tomatoes within it. If so, bring your pot to a simmer and add 1/4 teaspoon Baking Soda. Mix in and allow sauce to settle. It will foam up and even slightly discolor your sauce but it will return to normal within seconds so no worries! Taste test and add 1/4 teaspoon more if needed. Add 3-4 times @1/4 tsp at the most. Mix everything in your meatball section and your reserved 1/2 cup of spaghetti sauce very well and roll into any size meatball you desire. I roll mine into oversized quarter sizes and bake for about 20 minutes at 350. Heat oven to 350 and bake your meatballs in your disposable pan for 20-35 minutes [depending upon sizes] or until fully cooked. Don't let them dry them out by baking them too long. It's better you undercooked them. Remember, they have to bake in the oven again in that same pan. In a seperate pot, boil your noodles as per manufactures directions. [usually 8 to 12 minutes] Add 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon cooking oil to your boiling water before placing noodles in the pot and beginning your boil time. Drain noodles [do not rinse!] in sink and place your noodles in your spaghetti sauce pot. Drain meatballs as well [on paper towels] and place in that same spaghetti pot. Mix everything well but not so well you break up your meatballs. Re-spray your disposable pan again [if needed-and on the sides] with cooking oil and pile in your spaghetti and meatballs. Top with garlic powder, Parmesan and Motzerella Cheese and fresh Basil and Parsley. Bake at 350 for up to 30 minutes. Check dish while baking to see if your cheeses are melting and your spaghetti isn't drying out too much. Serve with Tabasco Sauce and warm Garlic bread on the side. Below is a 3 minute prep time-30 minute bake time recipe for one. Enjoy!",

While onions are cooking, rinse and sort through the lentils to remove any pebbles. Once the onions and garlic are translucent and fragrant, add lentils to the pot with the onions. Add water and bouillon base. Bring to a boil, and then reduce to a simmer for 20 minutes. 3. Add the cans of undrained tomatoes into the lentils, along with the spices.

Add oil, yogurt and remaining 1/4 cup warm water and mix well until there are no lumps. In a larger bowl or pot, add very warm water and place the mixing bowl with the batter inside the larger bowl. Cover the larger bowl and allow the batter to rest for 30 minutes. After the batter has been resting for 15 minutes, start on the syrup and preheat oil for frying the jalebi. For the syrup: In a heavy-bottomed pan, add water, sugar and saffron. Cook for 15 minutes on medium heat or until the temperature reaches 200 degrees F or 95 degrees C. Reduce heat to a low simmer and add cardamom powder, food color and lemon juice. Mix. (I like my jalebis bright yellow.) Mix the fermented jalebi batter well and put in a piping bag (a ketchup or mustard bottle, or Ziploc bag can be used, too). Squeeze out the batter into the hot oil in approximately 8 small circular motions. Jalebi should about 2-3 inches in diameter. Fry until the bottom side looks golden and flip once to cook the other side. With tongs, remove jabebi, shake off excess oil and place directly into sugar syrup. Allow jalebi to remain in the syrup for just a minute, flipping to coat both sides. Shake off excess sugar syrup and place onto a plate. (Note: About midway through the frying process, take the sugar syrup off heat so that it does not become too thick.) Continue frying remaining jalebis. Enjoy them hot for optimal taste or allow them to cool and store in a container with a tight-fitting lid. Jalebis will remain fresh for 4-5 days unrefrigerated.",

In this recipe, I use 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 teaspoon of Amaretto di Saronno, but you can replace the Amaretto with more vanilla if you like or vice versa. I find that the Amaretto enhances the nutty flavor of the Nutella. Preheat oven to 350F or 175C. Start by sifting the cocoa powder, flour and baking powder together. Add the salt to the mix and stir. In a saucepan on low heat, melt the butter or margarine, vanilla and amaretto. Add the sugar into the butter and mix til well combined and smooth.

        "1. Preheat your oven to 180 degrees C. 2. First, cook the quinoa. Thoroughly rinse the quinoa in a fine mesh strainer. Heat your olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat, then add your drained quinoa and stir for about a minute until some of the water has evaporated. Add the stock and a pinch of salt and bring the mixture to a rolling boil. Cover, reduce the heat to low and then continue cooking for 12-15 minutes. Turn off the heat, cover your saucepan and let the quinoa stand for five minutes. 3. While the quinoa is cooking, prepare the mushrooms. Remove the stems and place them gill-side-up on a parchment paper lined rimmed baking tray. Drizzle them with olive oil and massage with your hands to make sure the mushrooms are well coated. Cook them in the oven for about 8 minutes, until softened. Remove from oven. Once they are cool enough to handle, discard any excess liquid. 4. To make the pesto: Place the walnuts, basil leaves, garlic, olive oil, lemon zest and a pinch of salt in a food processor and blend until it forms a thick paste. 5. To assemble: Mix the cooked quinoa, pesto and capers together in a bowl. Next, pile the stuffing into your pre-cooked mushrooms, and top each with a slice of tomato. Season with salt and pepper. Return to the oven and cook for another 5 minutes, then turn on the broiler and cook for a further five minutes, until the tomatoes are cooked. Serve with a big green salad.",

Once milk has scalded, remove from microwave and then add sugar, butter, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Stir. Pour milk mixture in with yeast mixture. Add soy flour and pumpkin. Using dough hook, turn on your mixer and add flour gradually. Mix until dough all comes together. Remove dough from bowl and grease the bowl. Place dough back into the greased bowl and cover.

Knead the walnuts in and leave for the first rising (30 to 40 minutes). If using a bread machine, put in all the ingredients except for the shortening and start the dough kneading program. Add the shortening 10 minutes afterwards. After the 1st rising is finished, divide the dough and deflate lightly. Round out each piece of dough, and let it rest (for about 20 minutes). Deflate the dough lightly with your hands, and roll out with a rolling pin into an oval shape. Fold the left side in and press down lightly. Fold the right side in so that it overlaps the left side fold, and press down lightly. Fold in half, and seal. This is the sealed up bread dough.

While cooking the sausage patties, place the split English muffins in a toaster and brown to your liking. If you dont have a toaster, place both split English muffins on a tray in a preheated oven on broil setting. If you do this, make sure you keep an eye on them so that they dont burn. This is why I prefer using a toastertoo much stress for a morning meal is not worth it. Place two large sheets of aluminum foil on the counter, near the stove. When the muffins have toasted, place one muffin, both top and bottom pieces, on each sheet of aluminum foil. This eliminates cleaning plates. Did I tell you how much I hate doing dishes? Once the sausage patties are cooked, remove them from the skillet and place one on each of the bottom portions of the English muffins. Using the same pandid I tell you that I hate doing dishescrack the eggs into it and fry them according to your taste. My sausage oozed just enough fat to give me enough oil for the eggs. If your sausage is leaner, just put a small pat of butter in the pan. If not, just forge ahead as is. I like over easy with the yolks still nice and runny. Add salt and pepper to taste. Place the cooked eggs on top of the sausage patties. (I have made these with scrambled eggs, but find the eggs fall out of the muffin. So we fry our eggs. You can do what you desire. Its your sandwich.) Sprinkle half of the grated cheese over each egg. Place the remaining portions of the English muffins on top and encase the whole thing in the sheet of aluminum foil. This will allow the cheese to get melty and for the sandwich to stay warm longer. By now, your coffee is done. Put some in a to-go cup and you are on your way. This took me a whole 8 minutes to complete. I didnt have to stand in line; my sandwich was much tastier than one from a coffee shop; it was cheaper; and I only have the skillet, small grater and a spatula to clean up. I say that is a do-again.",

Add 2 quarts of the chicken stock and a pinch of salt and simmer over low heat until the onions and scallions are very soft, about 15 minutes. Working in batches, puree the soup in a blender until very smooth. Pour the soup into a clean saucepan and season with salt. Heat the remaining 2 teaspoons of olive oil in a medium saucepan. Add the potato, garlic and a pinch of salt and cook over low heat, stirring, until the potato pieces are glazed, about 2 minutes. Add the reserved 1/2 cup of chicken stock and 1/2 cup of water and simmer over moderately low heat until most of the liquid has evaporated and the potato is tender, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk the heavy cream until soft peaks form. Pass the potato through a ricer into a medium bowl. Fold the whipped cream into the potato and season with salt. Ladle the hot soup into warmed shallow bowls. Drizzle 8 drops of balsamic vinegar over each soup, then mound 2 tablespoons of the whipped potato in the center.

        "Manual Method:. In a large bowl, or the bowl of your electric mixer, combine all of the ingredients, stirring till the dough forms a cohesive mass and begins to clear the sides of the bowl. Knead the dough for 5 minutes, then allow it to rest for 10 minutes (which gives the dough a chance to absorb the liquid, and the gluten in the flour a chance to relax.) Knead the dough for an additional 5 minutes, or until it's smooth and supple. The dough should be quite stiff, but not at all \"gnarly;\" adjust its consistency with additional flour or water, as necessary. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl or dough-rising bucket, cover the bowl or bucket, and allow the dough to rise till it's noticeably puffy, about 1 hour. Bread Machine Method:. Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your machine, program the machine for manual or dough, and press start. About 10 minutes before the end of the final kneading cycle, examine the dough's consistency; it should be quite stiff, but not at all \"gnarly;\" adjust it consistency with additional flour or water, as necessary. Allow the machine to complete its cycle. Shaping:. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface, and divide it into six equal pieces. Shape the pieces into round balls, and place them on a lightly greased or parchment lined baking sheet. Working with one ball of dough at a time, center your kaiser stamp over the dough. Press down frimly, cutting to the bottom but not all the way through the dough. This is important; if you don't cut deeply enough, the shape disappears as the roll bakes; if you cut too deeply (all the way through), the roll will form \"petals\" as it rises and look like a daisy, not a kaiser roll. Practice makes perfect! Repeat with the remaining rolls. Place the rolls cut-side down (yes-cut-side down--this helps them retain their shape) onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover the rolls, and allow them to rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until they've almost doubled in volume. Turn the rolls cut-side up. Dip tops in milk and coat with poppy or sesame seeds, if desired. Bake the rolls in a preheated 425F oven vor 15 to 17 minutes, or until they're golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and cool on a wire rack.",

Place 5-6 cloves of garlic (depending on your garlic preference) in the middle of a square of tin foil and drizzle liberally with olive oil. Gather the corners/ends of the foil into one bunch up top so that the garlic is completely sealed in. Put this in the oven for 15-20 minutes.

Peel and quarter the potatoes and put them into a large pot with 1 tablespoon salt. Cover with cold water and bring to a boil. Boil uncovered until the potatoes come right off a fork when you stick them, about 15-20 minutes. While the potatoes are boiling melt butter in a small saucepan. Add cream, roasted garlic, salt and pepper and whisk together until combined. Bring to a boil then remove from heat, cover to keep warm. When potatoes are done, drain well. Either put them back in the pot, pour cream mixture over them, add the cheese then beat with an electric mixer or put them in your standing mixer bowl and use the whisk attachment to beat them.

        "Prepare your grill and get it fired up. I only use charcoal, so if you have a gas grill, just prep it the same way you would for any other grilling task. While its heating, prep your corn. Peel down the husks, but leave them attached to the cob. Remove all the stringy corn silk that you can, then pull husk back up to cover the corn again. Soak corn in a sink or big bowl full of cool water for about 10 minutes. By now, your grill should be nice and hot, and the charcoal should be covered with gray ash (if using a charcoal grill). Remove corn from sink and let most of the water drain out of the husks. Place on hot grill and turn it every few minutes to get a nice char on the husk (this gives a delicious smoky flavor to the corn while it steams in its own wrappings!) Grill for 15-20 minutes, or until desired doneness. While the corn is grilling, you can prep your mayo sauce. In a small bowl, mix mayonnaise, lemon juice, and chili powder. Or if you prefer, just the mayo and lemon juice. The chili powder can be sprinkled on by each individual person to their own tastes. When the corn is done, very carefully peel down the husks. (I usually let mine rest for a few minutes for safety purposes. That steam can hurt!) You can leave the husks attached as a makeshift handle if eating outside or just cut them off to prevent a mess if eating indoors. Slather the sauce over the cobs and serve, or divide the sauce into individual little bowls for everyone to add their own. Sprinkle with chili powder if not already added to sauce, and ENJOY! Leftover sauce also makes a delicious spread for turkey sandwiches or hamburgers! +++ I first tried a version of this recipe while in a Mexican border town. It was served hot and fresh from a street vendor and I was so surprised they were using liquid lemon-mayo instead of butter and seasoning it with chili powder. Ive made this many times and its always a hit in my house, even with my picky eater of a mother-in-law!",

Add carrot and potatoes and bring to a boil. Leave the pot uncovered so that the water previously added will evaporate and you will get a nice thick gravy. When the carrots and potato are just about cooked, add shrimp, bell pepper, fish sauce, sugar, chili peppers and curry powder. Simmer for 5 minutes until shrimp turn pink. Do not overcook at this stage as shrimp will turn rubbery. Top with chopped spring onions just before serving. (Note: Taste the curry and adjust seasonings as necessary at this time. Depending on the brand of curry powder you use, you may need to adjust the amount of sugar. I have found some bitter notes in certain brands, and increasing the sugar adjusts that.

When oil is hot, use an ice cream scoop to drop mixture into pan and then flatten with a fork. Fritters should only be flipped once so wait until the first side is a dark golden brown before flipping and browning the other side. Remove from skillet to a paper towel lined plate to drain any excess grease. Fritters are delicious on their own or can be served with hummus or a tzatziki sauce and nice thick slices of tomato. Enjoy!",

Keep the claws whole and set aside with the knuckles and tails. Heat a large soup/stock pot on medium with the oil. When oil is hot add the onion, celery, carrots and garlic and brown them for around 10 minutes. Once the veggies start to brown add the tomato paste. Season with salt and pepper. Allow the tomato paste to cook and brown off a little, 5 minutes Then add the lobster broth. Be sure to scrape anything off the bottom of the pan in order to combine with the liquid. Let the mixture simmer for ten minutes or until the vegetables are tender. Using an immersion blender or food processor, puree the soup. Be extra careful if you are using a food processor or regular blender to puree hot liquids (dont fill the canister too full)! Put the pureed soup back into the pot if you pureed it with a blender/food processor. Let the soup simmer for five more minutes. Turn down heat to medium/low and add the heavy cream. You can add as much or as little cream as you like, depending on how thick you want the soup. Be mindful though that the cream will dilute the delicate flavour of the broth. Check the seasoning, it will likely need more salt here. Keep soup on low heat for a few more minutes to make sure the cream has warmed through. Add fresh thyme leaves. Divide and lump the tail and knuckle meat between 4 large bowls. Ladle bisque over meat. Use the claws for garnish. Serve while still hot.",

Gradually add flours, mixing well to form a dough. Knead for 5 minutes using a stand mixer. 3. Lightly grease a large bowl, put dough into the bowl and let it rise in a warm place for about 30-40 minutes. 4. While dough is rising, whisk together the second amount of eggs, black pepper and milk in a medium-sized bowl. Heat a skillet to medium heat and add the egg mixture. Scramble until fairly dry, but do not overcook. Remove eggs from skillet and set aside. 5. Brown sausage in the skillet. Once browned, add onion and pepper. Saute 3-5 minutes, until veggies are softened. Add tomato and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated. Set aside. 6. Roll out risen dough on a lightly floured surface. Roll into a rectangular shape until it is about 1/4 inch thick. Evenly sprinkle eggs, sausage mixture, potatoes, and cheese over the top. Roll it up tightly, beginning on a long side. Roll gently so the dough doesnt rip. Pinch together the seams to seal. Cut into 1 inch slices. 7. Place rolls in lightly greased pans, placing them slightly apart. I used 9-inch pie pans and got about 6 per pan. Recipe makes 18-24 rolls. They should have room to expand as they rise. Let rolls rest in a warm place until about doubled in size, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 F. 8. Bake at 400 F for 15-20 minutes, until tops of rolls are browned. Serve warm. Can serve plain or with milk gravy on top.

        "For the cupcakes: 1) Preheat oven to 350F. Line 12 cupcake wells with liners. 2) In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside. 3) In a large bowl, cream together butter, sugar and lime zest until light in color. 4) Add in eggs one at a time, and beat mixture until smooth and well combined. 5) Mix into the creamed mixture one third of the flour mixture, followed by the yogurt. Mix in another third of the flour mixture, followed by the strawberry/lime juice puree. Stir in all remaining flour, mixing until no streaks of dry ingredients remain. 6) Spoon batter into prepared liners. Bake for 18-22 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. For the buttercream: 1) Combine the sugar, egg whites, cream of tartar and water in the stainless steel bowl of an electric mixer. Bring a large pan of water to simmer, making sure that the water is at the same height as the egg whites in your stainless bowl. Were looking for a double boiler setup. Set the bowl of sugar/egg mixture into the pan of simmering water and whisk constantly until the mixture reaches 140 degrees on an instant-read thermometer. Be careful to not curdle the egg whites simply remove the bowl from the heat for a bit if it feels like thats happening. Youll know when its getting close to 140 degrees; the mixture will be getting ultra foamy, like the top of a latte. 2) Remove the bowl with the egg white mixture to your stand mixer and beat on high speed for 3-5 minutes, until the mixture holds glossy, marshmallowy peaks. Remove the meringue to another bowl. 3) In the standing mixer, beat half of the butter and one-third of the meringue until well combined. Continue to add the remaining two-thirds of the meringue a dollop at a time. The mixture may look a bit curdled at this point but dont worry; adding the remaining butter a tablespoon at a time will smooth things out. Keep adding a bit of butter at a time until the curdling corrects itself. 4) With the mixer on low, add the lime zest and lime juice and mix until well combined. Begin to pour in powdered sugar in small increments and beat until the frosting reaches the desired consistency and sweetness. 5) Then pipe or frost onto your cooled cupcakes. And devour!",

        "Soak mushrooms in 5 cups boiling-hot water in a bowl, keeping them submerged with a small plate and turning mushrooms over occasionally, until softened and cool enough to handle, about 30 minutes. Squeeze excess liquid from caps back into bowl and reserve liquid, then cut out and discard stems from mushrooms. Cut caps into 1-inch wedges. While mushrooms soak, carefully break bean curd skins in half crosswise, then halve each portion crosswise again. Transfer to a bowl, then add enough boiling-hot water to cover and soak, turning occasionally, until softened, about 30 minutes. If using fresh bamboo, trim bottoms of shoots, then halve shoots lengthwise with a sharp heavy knife. Pull off and discard leaves from shoots, then remove any blemishes with a sharp paring knife (don't worry about natural dotted pattern along base of shoots). Cover fresh or frozen bamboo with cold water by 1 inch in a 2-quart saucepan and bring to a boil. Boil 2 minutes, then drain in a colander and rinse under cold water. Repeat boiling and rinsing, then arrange bamboo halves, cut sides down, on a cutting board and cut bamboo lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Soak noodles in cold water to cover until softened, about 5 minutes, then drain in colander and transfer to a bowl. Drain bean curd skins in colander. When cool enough to handle, squeeze dry and cut crosswise into 1-inch pieces. Halve tofu lengthwise, then cut each half crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Heat oil in a 5- to 6-quart wide heavy pot over moderate heat until hot but not smoking. Add ginger and garlic and cook, stirring, 30 seconds. Add mushrooms, bean curd skins, bamboo, and ginkgo nuts and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Stir in oyster sauce, soy sauce, rice wine, and sugar and simmer 1 minute. Add reserved mushroom-soaking liquid and bring to a boil. Gently stir in tofu and soybean sprouts, then reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, 15 minutes. Gently stir in noodles and simmer, covered, 5 minutes. Add romaine hearts (pot will be full) and turn to coat, then simmer, covered, until romaine is tender, about 5 minutes.",

        "Line a baking sheet with foil. Remove the stems from the mushrooms. Just twist them slightly and pop them out to make a hole in the bottom of the mushroom. Arrange the mushrooms on the cookie sheet. Next, mix the cream cheese and chopped bacon with a fork. You will have a chunky mixture once it is combined. Pack the cream cheese mixture into the mushrooms. Keep the mixture somewhat level to the mushroom, so that the cheese does not ooze out when it is baked. Next, top the mushrooms with the shredded cheese. A nice quick way to do this is to simply tip the packed cream cheese mixture onto the shredded cheese quickly, and then you will have the shredded cheese on top. Repeat with the remaining mushrooms. This can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for several hours until needed, or baked right away. Bake uncovered at 400 degrees F for 12-15 minutes (until the mushrooms are browned, and the tops are melted). Wait a couple of minutes before tastingthese are very hot when they come out!",
