        "Preheat the oven to 325. Butter two 8-inch square baking pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Butter the paper and dust the pans with flour, tapping out the excess. In a large bowl, whisk the 2 cups of flour with the sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In a medium bowl, whisk the milk with the vegetable oil, eggs and vanilla. Add the liquid to the dry ingredients and whisk just until smooth. Scrape the batter into the prepared pans. Bake for about 40 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out with a few crumbs attached. Let cool in the pans on a wire rack, then turn out to cool completely. Peel off the parchment. Turn the cakes right side up onto 2 baking sheets. In a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over the cold water and let stand until softened, about 5 minutes. In a medium saucepan, combine 1/2 cup of the sugar with the corn syrup and stir over moderate heat until the sugar is thoroughly dissolved. Bring the corn syrup mixture to a boil, wiping down any sugar crystals that may form on the side of the pan with a moistened pastry brush. Cook over moderate heat, without stirring, until the corn syrup mixture reaches 250 on a candy thermometer, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the softened gelatin; the mixture will foam up. Meanwhile, in the bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with a whisk, beat the egg whites and vanilla seeds at medium speed until soft peaks form. Add the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well between additions. Beat until the whites are stiff and glossy, about 5 minutes. With the mixer at medium speed, carefully pour the hot corn syrup mixture in a thin stream into the egg whites, aiming for the area between the whisk and side of the bowl. Beat the topping until very thick and opaque, about 8 minutes. Preheat the broiler and position a rack 8 inches from the heat. Using an offset spatula, spread the marshmallow topping over the tops of the cakes. Let stand for about 1 minute, until slightly set. Broil the cakes one at a time, shifting the pan as necessary for even browning, about 5 minutes. Insert the broken graham crackers into the marshmallow and drizzle with the melted chocolate. Serve while the marshmallow is still warm.",

Cut room temperature butter into small pieces and rub into flour with fingertips until distributed evenly. I do this in a food processor and just keep pulsing until the butter is evenly distributed and there are no clumps. Dont walk away and leave the machine on or you will end up with a butter ball. Mix the rose water with the filtered water and sprinkle onto flour mixture. Pulse again to form a firm dough and then knead lightly until smooth. Cover the dough with cling film and rest for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile make the filling Chop the dates and then gently heat them on low with the butter, stirring until the dates have softened about 5 10 minutes, depending on your dates. Remove from the heat and set aside. Roll the dough into small round balls about the size of a large walnut or tablespoon. Flatten each ball like a pancake in the palm of your hand and place a teaspoonful of the date filling in the centre. Fold over the edges of the dough to close over and cover the date filling. Roll the dough back into a ball with your hands. This can be a bit tricky if you fill the balls with too much filling. If you want to be really traditional you can press each ball into a special Middle Eastern carved mould similar to a tabi. Alternatively, (which is the way I did it) press each side of the ball with a fork to indent, slightly flatten, and then press the sides of the balls to round up, before placing on a baking sheet. Bake in the oven at about 160 C / 325 F oven for 30 minutes until lightly browned. Allow the cookies to cool on the tray as they will firm up and get a little bit more crispy.

        "For the cake: Preheat oven to 350 F; spray a 9x13 pan with cooking spray and set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, egg whites, vanilla and food coloring; set aside. In the large bowl of an electric mixer, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt; add butter and beat on low speed until all of the ingredients are in wet lumps. Add half of the milk mixture and beat on medium speed for 1-2 minutes or just until combined; scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula and then add remaining milk mixture; beat on medium speed just until combined without over-mixing. Pour batter into prepared pan and bake 25-35 minutes or until a knife comes out clean after inserting it into the center. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool while you prepare buttercream. Cake recipe adapted from Baking Bites. For the buttercream: Beat butter and cream cheese in the bowl of an electric mixer on high speed or until light and creamy. Add one cup of powdered sugar and mix on low speed for one minute; add remaining sugar, vanilla and food coloring. Mix on low speed for one minute and then scrape the sides of the bowl; beat on high speed for several minutes or until buttercream is light and fluffy. To prepare the cake pops: Line a baking sheet with wax paper and set aside. Break the cooled cake into pieces and place them in a large bowl; crumble cake into small crumbs with your fingers. Add buttercream to the cake and mix with a spoon until all of thecake crumbs are coated. Use a medium cookie dough scoop or large spoon to scoop balls of dough onto a wax paper-lined baking sheet. Use your hands to roll the cake scoops into balls. Cover the sheet with another sheet of wax paper and place it in the freezer for at least two hours. Prepare another baking sheet with wax paper for finished pops. Once cake balls are frozen, you can make them into pops. Put the white chocolate in a heat-safe bowl and place it over a pot of simmering water (or you can use a double boiler); stir chocolate constantly until melted (you can also melt the white chocolate in the microwave in 30 second heat bursts). Remove balls from the freezer; dip the top of each lollipop stick about 1/3 of an inch into the melted white chocolate and immediately press the stick into the cake ball two thirds of the way through. Once complete, dip each cake pop, one at a time, into the white chocolate; lightly tap off excess chocolate and place cake pop on the wax paper lined baking tray; decorate with sprinkles immediately before chocolate hardens. Repeat until all cake pops are dipped and decorated. Allow to cool and for chocolate to harden before serving. Cake pops inspired by the amazing Bakerella.",

You may cut your ribs into sections before brining, if desired. Mix together beer, salt, brown sugar, celery seed, cayenne pepper, black pepper and liquid smoke in a saucepan. Heat over low heat, stirring gently until all the salt dissolves; allow to cool. Place rib sections in a large ziplock or resealable bag and pour the cooled brine over; squeeze out as much air as possible and seal the bag. Allow the ribs to brine in this mixture, for 6 hours or overnight, rotating bag occasionally. Prior to cooking, remove ribs from brine and pat dry; discard used brine. Using a drip pan, prepare a grill for indirect cooking. Place the ribs over the drip pan and grill using indirect medium heat (test by placing your hand over the heat- you should be able to keep it there for about 3 seconds). Cover grill and cook for 1 1/2- 1 3/4 hours or until the ribs are tender, and the meat has pulled back from the edges of the bone slightly. Add additional coals during cooking if needed. Baste with honey bbq sauce during the last minutes of cooking, allowing the sauce to set. To make the sauce, cook onion and garlic in oil in a small saucepan until the onions become tender. Add the chili sauce, beer, honey, Worcestershire sauce and mustard to the pan, stirring to mix well. Bring sauce to a boil, then lower heat and simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until it is as thick as you like it. Use sauce on ribs as a baste; sauce can be prepared ahead.",

Add two small chunks of fruit wood (apple or cherry) and one small chunk of hickory to the fire about 10 minutes before youre ready to cook. Wood chips soaked for 30-60 minutes will work well, too. If youre using a gas grill, make a smoker pouch. Cook the roast indirect until the internal temperature reaches 170-180 degrees (about two hours). Pull off a five foot long piece of wide (18) heavy-duty foil and fold it in half to form a double layer. Put the roast in the center of the foil. Form a boat by folding all the edges up slightly. Add the beer to the foil. Bring the two long edges together and roll them toward the roast to form a seal. Fold the short edges over the top of the rolled edges to close the packet. Put the packet back on the grill/cooker and continue cooking indirect until the internal temperature reaches 200 degrees . Remove the packet from the grill and let rest for 15-20 minutes.

With your hands, mix in as much of the flour as needed to make a rough dough. You may not need to incorporate all the flour. Or if the dough is too sticky, you may need to sprinkle over a little extra flour. As soon as the dough begins to form a ball turn it out onto a work surface lightly dusted with flour. Knead the dough until smooth, elastic and no longer sticky, about 10 minutes. Wrap in clingfilm and leave to rest for at least 30 minutes or up to 4 hours. (You can make the dough in two batches - mix 300 g of flour with 1/2 tsp of salt and 3 eggs, then repeat with the remaining 300 g of flower, salt and 3 eggs, for easier kneading). Sprinkle some sea salt on pumpkin and put it in the oven to cook at 200C for about 40 minutes. Check if it's ready with a fork. It should be fairly soft. While the pumpkin is cooking, set the ricotta cheese in a sieve lined with cheese cloth over a bowl for the extra liquid to drain. When the squash is cooked, spoon out its flesh into a bowl, add the ricotta, a pinch of nutmeg, some salt and pepper and mix well. Roll the pasta dough using a machine or a rolling pin into long sheets and place one sheet in a well-floured ravioli form. Press it into the form, so that little wells for the filling will form. Spoon the ricotta and squash mix into the wells, but don't overfill them, because excess filling will spread around the dough when rolling. Brush the dough around the mix with water, and cover with another pasta sheet. Roll with the rolling pin on top to cut into individual ravioli. (Alternatively, simply lay a pasta sheet on a floured working surface, place teaspoons of the squash mis in 2 rows at 5 cm intervals, leaving a 2 cm border around the edges. Brush the dough around the edges with water. Top with another pasta sheet and press the edges together to dal. Cut into squares with a ravioli cutter or a knife). To make the sage-butter sauce, melt the butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the sage leaves and cook, stirring occasionally, for 4-5 minutes until the sage is crisp and the butter is light golden. Don't let your eyes off the pan at this stage, as butter and sage leaves burn easily. Cook half the ravioli in a large saucepan of salted boiling water for 5-8 minutes or until al dente. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining pasta. Divide the ravioli among serving bowls and spoon over the sage-butter sauce.",

Roll or stretch out your dough ball and lay in the bottom of the hot pan. Spread a good spoonful of the tomato sauce onto the base (leaving a 1\" crust). Season with a pinch of Parmesan.

        "Begin by scoring your pork belly. With a sharp knife slice into the fat, making cross marks, just deep enough to not cut through the pork. Poke the bottom and side of the pork, making incisions throughout the pork. Mix the all of the remaining ingredients, with the exception of the salt and vinegar. Place the pork in a large Ziplock bag, and pour in the mixed ingredients. Seal and begin massaging the pork, getting the mixture rubbed into the pork. Rub it well. Let sit in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, but overnight if you can. When you are ready to cook the pork, remove it from the bag and place fat side up on a large baking sheet that has been covered with foil and lined with a grated baking rack. Preheat your oven to 425 degrees F. Take some paper towel and completely dry or remove any moisture from the top fat of the pork. Sprinkle the salt and brush the vinegar on top of the fat. Place the baking sheet with the pork (fat side up) in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. As it cooks, the pork begins to brown and crisp up while some of that fatty goodness drips down onto the pork itself, adding more flavor. After the 30 minutes, reduce the heat to 350 degrees F and cook for one hour. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the pork cool. Combine all of the dipping sauce ingredients in a bowl. When you are ready to serve, cut into bite sized pieces and serve with the dipping sauce. Not only are these crispy pork belly nuggets addicting, but they are so delicious.

        "Boil the pasta until its all done. Drain off the water and run through cold water. Put some olive oil and toss pasta. Keet it aside. At same time, take tomatoes and cut crosses on the ends. Throw the tomatoes in a vessel, pour some water into it and bring it to a boil. Keep boiling the tomatoes until they are fully cooked. Meanwhile, grill the capsicums (peppers) on a grill or directly on the stove. You will need to turn the capsicum after every 5-10 seconds if you choose the second option, so that it is uniformly charred on all sides. After completely charring the capsicum, let it cool down. Once tomatoes are fully cooked, the skin will start to separate. Turn off the heat. Drain off the water. Run cold running water over the tomatoes to cool them down. Peel off the skin and throw the tomatoes in the mixer. Set aside. Once the capsicum has cooled, peel off the charred outer skin and remove the seeds from it. Throw it into the mixer with tomatoes. Dice 1 onion into large pieces and throw them in mixer as well. Throw 3 4 garlic cloves in mixer, followed by the black peppercorns. Now everything is done for the pasta sauce. Just run the bmixer and you will get a blackish-greenish-reddish gravy in the mixer. Let it sit so the flavors can meld. Finely chop the remaining garlic cloves and the onion. In a skillet over heat, add olive oil/butter. (Use as much as youd like. If you are health-conscious, use about 2 to 3 tablespoons of olive oil.) Drop the remaining black peppercorns (or you can use freshly ground black pepper) to the olive oil. Throw in the finely chopped garlic and onion. Then drop 1/2 teaspoons of crushed mixed herbs. Saute it until onion starts turning golden brown. Add the pasta sauce to the skillet and saute the entire thing for 2 3 minutes. Toss cooked pasta in the skillet. Mix well. Simmer, covered, for 3 to 4 minutes. Then turn off the heat. Keep the skillet covered for about 10 minutes more. Take out in a serving dish. Decorate with your choice of grated cheese. Serve pasta with garlic bread.",

This batter is very wet and without spritzing the baking cups the paper will stick to the cakes. I find the foil baking cups work even better. In the bowl of an electric mixer, mix sugar, flour, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Set aside Melt 2 sticks of butter in medium saucepan. Once its melted add the cup of chai. I use the Tazo Chai concentrate because its easy. You could certainly make your own chai but make sure you use several tea bags to 1 cup of water. You want the chai to be really strong. After you add the concentrated chai to the butter, add 2 chai tea bags to the pot. Bring it to a boil then turn the heat off, cover the pot and let it steep for about 5 minutes. While thats doing its thing get another bowl and mix the buttermilk, baking soda, eggs and vanilla together. Remove the tea bags and add the chai/butter mix slowly to the flour mixture stirring gently. I use setting 2 on my Kitchen Aid. It doesnt have to be one homogenous mix yet you dont want to cook the eggs when you add the the buttermilk mix to the batter. Another way to cool it down is to pour it down the sides of the bowl as you add it to the flour. After a few gentle turns of the machine add the buttermilk mixture to the bowl. Make sure its all well combined and then portion out the batter into the muffin cups. I use a 1/4 cup so that the cupcakes end up mostly the same size. This batter is very wet! Bake for about 20 minutes at 350 degrees or until a toothpick inserted the middle comes out clean. When done remove from oven and cool on a rack until they are cool to the touch. Dont rush or the buttercream will melt all over your cupcakes. Tasty yes but very messy and not nearly so pretty. For the Icing: With an electric mixer beat the butter and cream cheese until it is nice and creamy. Add the honey. Mix until fluffy. This is a softer frosting and if you plan on piping it I would recommend putting it in the fridge for a little while to get it firmed up. Go ahead and frost the cooled cupcakes. I find that just a thin smear on the top is more than enough and lets the taste of the chai shine through. Enjoy! !",

        "I used a mixture of color and sizes of tomatoes for complexity of flavor and texture. Good tomatoes are a must. Slice tomatoes about a quarter inch thick and very lightly salt both sides. Mix herbs into tomatoes and let sit for 10+ minutes while oven is preheating at 350F. Lightly roll out puff pastry to fit your preferably deep dish pie pan. Place pastry in pan and cut excess off with a knife around edge of pan. Prick holes in bottom crust and bake for 5 minutes at 350 or until slightly cooked. This can be done while preheating, but will take longer. Drain tomatoes and if they are mostly sweet add lemon juice to balance. If you have some green or tart tomatoes, omit lemon. Save reserved liquid for a soup or chugging later. Add crushed croutons and dill paste if desired. Mix everything together. Layer tomatoes neatly into par baked crust and fill gaps with mositened crouton crumbs. Use puff pastry scraps to make a broken top crust by stretching pieces over top of pie. Beat the 6 eggs (or less) in a bowl and slowly pour into crevices of pie. Lightly brush top crust with some egg. Bake for 30 minutes or until top crust is lightly browned and eggs are fully set. Let cool 10 minutes before serving with mixed baby greens. Await praise from family and friends.",

        "Step 1-the roasted veggies. Gather as many as you have/want of the first 4 ingredients, chop into large cubes. Toss with some olive oil, red wine vinegar, and spices (or use bottled Italian salad dressing or balsamic vinaigrette). Spread cubed veggies in a shallow pan, add cloves of garlic, and roast at 400 degrees for 20-40 minutes until theyve given up their liquid but are not burnt. Set aside to cool, and then if you (or your picky kids) prefer, toss into a food processor to finely chop or even puree. Seriously, my kids knowingly eat eggplant this way. Step 2-the tomatoes. Ive used so many kinds of tomatoes and they all work-for a slicing tomato cut into quarters. For a Roma or plum tomato cut in half. For a cherry tomato leave whole. Drizzle olive oil on a shallow roasting pan. Add tomatoes cut side up. Drizzle more olive oil on top, and sprinkle Italian seasoning blend, salt and pepper over top. Roast at 400 degrees for 20-40 minutes or until dried but not charred. Set aside to cool, then remove skins (they should come right off though your fingers get messy) and place in a bowl. Add a healthy pinch of sugar. Step 3-the meat. Break up the Italian sausage links and cook in a large Dutch oven over medium until evenly browned. Remove to cool and roughly chop (or toss in the food processor and pulse a couple of times). Step 4-the veggie base. Finely chop (or toss in the food processor) some onion, celery, carrot, and fennel (also known as anise). Add to the Dutch oven used to cook the sausage. Saute over medium heat until softened. Step 5-bring it all together. To the veggies in the Dutch oven add the tomatoes, the meat, the roasted veggies. Stir to combine. Add 1 or 2 cans of tomato paste (and 1 or 2 cans of red wine/water/V8 juice) and a large can of crushed tomatoes. If it still seems thick, add more tomato paste or crushed tomatoes. Simmer over medium low heat for an hour or until you remember it, add salt and pepper to taste. This freezes well in quart size Ziploc bags. My family uses about 3 generous cups for a meal of spaghetti, so to fill my Dutch oven (and empty my veggie crisper) I use about 2-4 Asian and 4 small round eggplants, 2 zucchini, 2 yellow squash, most of a package of mushrooms, 1 head garlic, 1 onion, 3 or 4 quarts of any kind of tomatoes, 1 lb Italian sausage, a generous cup each chopped celery, carrot, and fennel, 2 cans of tomato paste, and 1 large (28 oz) can crushed tomatoes.

        "For the dough: In a large bowl mix yeast and water together until the yeast dissolves. Gradually add flour until you have a slurry (like oatmeal). Add the salt and olive oil and mix in. Continue to add the flour until the dough comes together and you can remove the dough from the bowl onto a floured surface. Start to knead and incorporate more flour until your dough is no longer sticky. Continue to knead for 10 minutes adding small amounts of additional flour as needed. Do not make the dough too dry. Knead again 50 times. Remove dough from your work surface into an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap and let rise for several hours. Divide dough into two or four pieces and roll out to desired thickness. We made ours about 1/3 or so, into a large oval shape. Let the dough rest for 20 minutes. For the assembly: Spread the pizza sauce over half of each dough circle, leaving a good border on the outside edge. Now divide all the toppings amongst the pizzas evenly, topping only half of the pizza again. Lightly dab water all the way around the edge and fold over the empty half of the dough circles onto itself (over the filled side). Lightly press the edges together. Slide calzones onto a floured baking sheet. Brush lightly with olive oil. Heat your BBQ grill to 375-400 F and flip the calzones out of the sheet onto the BBQ. Turn BBQ to low. Brush the top side lightly with olive oil. You may want to do this in batches depending on the size of your BBQ grill. Close lid and cook for 10-15 minutes making sure not to burn bottom. During the last few minutes of cooking, turn on the broiler in your oven. Take the calzones off the BBQ grill and put them on a sheet pan. Put the pan into the oven and broil top until golden brown. Remove them from the oven and let them sit for 5 minutes. Cut into triangles. It is crazy good! !",

        "Prepare a 9x9 baking dish by spraying it with non-stick spray and coating the inside with powdered sugar. Be generous with the sugar. Trust me when I tell you this stuff is as sticky as it is delicious! For the stout marshmallow creme: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, add the water and gelatin. Add stout, syrup, sugar, and salt to a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir occasionally until mixture comes to a rolling boil. Swirl the pan for about 5 -10 minutes, or until the mixture reaches about 230 F. Turn mixer on low to combine gelatin and water. Keep mixer on low speed and slowly drizzle in the hot syrup until it is all combined. Turn mixer to high speed for about 4-6 minutes or until mixture about triples in size. Pour marshmallow creme into prepared pan and cover with plastic wrap that has been sprayed with non-stick spray. This will keep it moist while you make the whiskey marshmallow creme. For the whiskey marshmallow creme: Do the exact same process above, only adding whiskey to the sugar, syrup, and salt instead of stout. Remove plastic wrap from stout marshmallow creme, and pour whiskey marshmallow creme on top. Working quickly before creme starts to stiffen, swirl the two together with a large spoon. Cover with plastic wrap again, but this time you dont have to grease it. When you lift it off, the marshmallows will be set, and it shouldnt stick. Let marshmallows set overnight at room temperature, then slice to desired size and roll in powdered sugar. For the latte: Steam the milk and Irish cream (it can simply be heated if you dont have a milk frother, but there wont be any foam). Portion milk into four glasses. Pour approximately 3 ounces of espresso into each glass. Top with marshmallows. Enjoy your Irish Car Bomb Latte!",

Add the chopped bacon and cook just until the bacon is just slightly crisp, as we will finish cooking the bacon on the pizza in the oven. Pour the bacon grease into a bowl and set it aside. Wipe out the skillet with a paper towel and be careful not to burn yourself. Return the skillet to the stove and place it back on medium heat. Spoon a couple of tablespoons of the reserved bacon grease into the skillet, and then add the Brussels sprouts. Season with a bit of salt, and cook on medium heat just until slightly tender. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Remove the Brussels sprouts and wipe out the skillet once more time. Drizzle in more of the bacon grease into the skillet. Take pizza dough and gently stretch it into the skillet. Spread the pizza sauce onto the dough, season with the cracked black pepper, salt, and Italian seasoning. Top with the mozzarella cheese, lay the Brussels sprouts on top, and shower with the bacon. Lay the red onion on top as well. Place the skillet in preheated oven, and cook for about 20 minutes or until the top is nice and melted. Using a spatula, lift the pizza out of the skillet, and slice and serve. The flavor combination is awesome. Its everything you expect with the bacon and Brussels sprouts but in pizza form. The red onion and the tomato sauce really add that perfect punch to the pizza as well, and if you have never made pizza in a cast iron skillet before, I highly recommend it. Hope you enjoy!",

Saute everything for about 3 to 4 minutes, just until the onions become slightly translucent and the tomatoes and artichokes begin to become tender. Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside for later use. Place the pork tenderloin in a 9x13 baking dish, rub some coconut oil all over and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. In order to stuff the loin, create a seam in the meat by cutting it down the center lengthwise, essentially, you want to be able to unfold the meat. Set the meat aside until the stuffing has been prepared. Preheat your oven to 450F. Turn your attention back to the stuffing. Once the ingredients from the skillet have completely cooled, whisk in an egg. The egg is essential to the stuffing, as this is what replaces the usual breadcrumbs and works to hold everything together. However, to make this work best, tomato/artichoke mixture must be cool, otherwise it will cook the egg before it is even stuffed in the meat and the egg will no longer act as a glue, since it cannot be cooked twice. Take the stuffing and begin spreading it across the seam of the meat. Avoid filling the meat too much, as you will not be able to fold the pork closed. Use some toothpicks to ensure the tenderloin does not pop open while cooking. Cook, uncovered, at 450 F for 30 minutes. Once the first 30 minutes have passed, reduce the heat to 300 F and cook for another 20 minutes. When the time is up, turn off the oven, but allow the meat to remain in it for at least 15 minutes. This cooking method is perfect for keeping the meat from overcooking and becoming dry. Bon apetit!",

Press garlic and chop fresh parsley, and add remaining ingredients for the chimichurri sauce to a food processor. Blend for a few seconds until parsley is finely chopped. Slice the pork tenderloin into 1.5 inch medallions. Using a large zip lock bag, add sliced pork medallions and chimichurri sauce. Allow to marinate for at least 1 hour. Remove pork medallions and discard marinade. Wrap each pork medallion with a slice of bacon. Begin to thread pork medallions onto skewers. Important - do not over-thread skewers (allow 1/4\" in between each piece) allowing bacon to cook. Use as many skewers as necessary. Preheat grill to medium heat. Once heated, add skewers and cook for 4 minutes on all 4 sides for a total grilling time 16 minutes. Internal temperature should be 145 degrees Fahrenheit.

Add remaining 1 cup water, all-purpose flour, cornmeal, 1 1/2 cups bread flour and the salt; stir to form a dough. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface for 10 minutes, adding more flour as needed to make a smooth, soft, elastic and only slightly sticky dough. Or if preferred you can knead it for 5 minutes in a stand mixer with dough hook attachment on medium speed, adding more flour as needed to make a smooth, soft, elastic and only slightly sticky dough. By hand, carefully knead in the sun-dried tomatoes, olives and basil until evenly distributed throughout dough. Shape dough into a ball and place in a large, lightly oiled bowl; turn to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise in a warm place for 1 to 1 1/2 hours until doubled. When dough is doubled, line a baking sheet with parchment paper and sprinkle lightly with flour.

When the chicken is browned and the veggies are softened, add the seasoning mix, stirring it in well to coat the meat and veggies. Pour in the water and mix well, scraping the bottom of the pan to release any flavours (deglazing). Drop the heat to medium-low and let the chicken simmer until its no longer pink and the fajita seasoning has formed a sauce. Serve with warmed tortillas and toppings of your choice.

Set aside. In another bowl, whisk the boiling water and cocoa powder until smooth. Set aside. Beat together the butter and sugar on medium speed in the bowl of a standing mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Beat in buttermilk and vanilla extract. Reduce the speed to low and beat in 1/3 of the flour mixture, followed by half of the cocoa mixture. Repeat with another 1/3 of the flour mixture and the remaining chocolate mixture. Beat in the remaining flour mixture until just incorporated. Divide the batter (using a 1 cup measure) and evenly pour into the prepared pans, smoothing the surface with a spatula. Bake 13 to 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean. Place the cakes (in the pans) on a wire rack to cool. Then invert the cakes onto a greased rack. Cool completely before frosting. To prepare the buttercream, put egg whites and sugar in a mixing bowl over a pot of simmering water. Use an electric hand mixer to beat constantly until the sugar has completely dissolved and the egg whites are hot. Remove from heat. With whisk attachment, continue whipping the mixture in a standing mixer until thick, glossy, and cool. Switch over to the paddle attachment. While mixing on medium speed, continuously add chunks of the softened butter until fully incorporated. Continue to mix until it has reached a silky smooth texture. If it curdles, keep mixing and it will come back to smooth. Add vanilla and salt and mix well. Right before frosting the cake, add the espresso into the buttercream and beat for another 10 seconds. Reserve 1 cup of buttercream for piping on top. To assemble the cake, place one cake layer on your serving plate and spread with 1/3 cup of the buttercream. Repeat this process until all cake layers are placed. Smear buttercream on top and sides of the cake. Garnish with the sliced almonds. Use a large star tip to pipe a decorative border on the top edge of the cake. Cover and refrigerate the cake. Leave out in room temperature for at least an hour prior to serving.",

Put the carcase, any drippings you have, and any stray parts like wingtips, that leg no one wanted, and pieces of skin into a stockpot. Peel and quarter the onion. Add it to the pot. Break the celery into 2-3 pieces and add that as well. Add COLD water to come up about 3/4 of the way up the bones. Bring to a simmer and simmer gently for 3-4 hours. Cool and refrigerate to congeal the grease. The next day, remove the congealed grease (if it didn't harden sufficiently in the fridge give it a couple hours in the freezer). Warm the broth enough to be comfortable for your hands. Strain the warmed broth through a colander into another pot. (Some people like to line the colander with cheesecloth). Pick the useful meat from the bones and return it to the broth. Proceed with the soup or freeze for later use. Note -- remember the pot/bowl when straining the broth. Every soup maker has forgotten at least once. :oops:. Add tomatoes, garlic, thyme, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil. Add the spinach and return to a boil. Add the rotini, return to a boil, then simmer for 10-12 minutes or until the pasta is cooked, stirring several times. Serve sprinkled with Parmesan or Asiago cheese. Note, its out of season after Thanksgiving, but if you have some fresh basil available, chop a few leaves and scatter a pinch over each bowl before adding the cheese.

Add eggs, milk, oil, vanilla, and sherry, and mix on low until just combined. Add boiling water and mix until smooth. Make sure to scrape the sides of your bowl and make sure the batter under your beater is incorporated. Batter will be thin. Prepare 2 9-inch aluminum round pans (you can also use a sheet pan, cupcake pans, 3 8-inch pans, or 1 10-inch pan). Just make sure to adjust batter amounts and baking time accordingly, keeping in mind that pans should be roughly 1/2 full). To prepare the pans put Bakers Joy, flour and grease, or a comparable mixture in the bottom and around the edges. I make my own Bakers Joy: I use a paste made from 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup shortening, and 1-1 1/2 cups flour, which keeps very well in the fridge. Grease the pan, place a parchment circle in the bottom, and grease the parchment. (If making cupcakes, use cupcake papers and no grease.) This greasing and pan-prep process is especially important with dark pans or pans larger than 10 inches around. If using pans larger than 10 inches, I recommend that you use a heating core or flower nail in centre of pan to conduct heat to the center of the cake (allowing the middle to bake before the edges burn). Bake at 350 for 16-35 minutes, depending on your oven and the size of your pan. Keep an eye on it and check for doneness with a toothpick. Frost with your favourite icing or eat it plain.

Let the steak sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes. While the steak is sitting, preheat your grill for indirect heat at medium heat (about 300 degrees F). Grill the steak indirect until the internal temperature is about 15 degrees F below your desired final doneness (this will be about 30 minutes for a final medium-rare), flipping once at the halfway point. Remove the steak to a platter and stoke/increase your fire for direct grilling at high heat (preferably 500+ degrees F). Once grill has reached high heat add the steaks. Sear each side of the steak until it is browned nicely. Stay close to the grill and flip the steak every minute or two to ensure even searing. Remove it from the grill onto a platter, tent loosely with foil and let rest. While the steak is resting, make the sauce. Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat, add the bourbon and very carefully set it alight to burn off the alcohol. Warning: The blue alcohol flames can rise up to 18 or more inches from the top of the pan, so ensure that you have adequate clearance above the pan. When the blue flames have subsided, add the cream, Worcestershire sauce and beef base to the pan. Bring to a simmer while whisking well, then reduce to low and cook two minutes, whisking occasionally. Remove the steak from the platter to a cutting board. Add the released steak juices into the sauce and whisk well and remove from the heat. Pour the sauce into the platter. Slice the steak on a bias (diagonal) at about 1/4, place the slices in the sauce on the platter. Or, you can do what I did and serve it whole. Serve and enjoy!

Combine 1/2 cup honey, 1 teaspoon of the grated lemon peel, 2 whole eggs and vanilla into another. Stir dry and wet ingredient together. Drop spoonfuls of batter into the cupcake tin. Bake for 45 minutes. When done, the tops will be lightly browned and a toothpick inserted will come out clean. If you take them out too soon, they will fall leaving an indention. You can put them back into the oven until they are completely done. The indention actually works great because you can plop on more frosting! Once the cupcakes are in the oven, begin heating the 1/2 cup honey on the stove top at medium heat. Add 1 teaspoon of grated lemon peel to the honey. Stir frequently until the honey comes to a boil, lower heat and continue to simmer for 8-10 minutes more. Youre looking for a slight browning of the honey. When you get to that stage, remove from heat. Whip egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Add the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of grated lemon peel to the whipped egg whites. Now drizzle the warm cooked honey over the egg whites and continue to whip until you get a marshmallow-like consistency. Allow the cupcakes to cool completely and then heap the frosting onto the cupcakes. These have very light lemon taste and are so delicious. For the cupcakes that fall, there is an indention to fill with more frosting! They will keep in the fridge for about twenty-four hours but are best served within a few hours.",

Add the grated apple and garlic to the basic Chinese dressing, and mix well. You can store the basic Chinese dressing for a long time, but once you add in the apple, you can't do that, so please make it each time. Rip up the loose leaf lettuce into bite-sized pieces. Squeeze the excess water out from the apple and cucumber, then mix with the lettuce. Mix the vegetables with the Choregi dressing, and done. Please just toss the vegetables in the dressing instead of rubbing it in. Shred the white part of the Japanese leek, and put a lot of it on top the salad.

Then stir in the yeast mixture. Add the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition. When the dough has started to pull together, add the cranberries and the sunflower seeds.

Grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans. Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form into loaves. Place the loaves into the prepared pans. (The dough can also be formed into longer loaves and placed on lightly greased baking sheets.) Cover with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven, then decrease heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and continue to bake for another 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 F. Lightly pierce the bottom and sides of the crust with a fork, then top the pie with a piece of parchment paper and bake for 20 minutes. Then remove the parchment and continue baking about 10 more minutes or until lightly golden. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely. Meanwhile, make the crumb: Mix all of the crumb ingredients together in a medium-sized bowl and crumble it over a wax paper lined baking sheet. Freeze for at least 30 minutes or until ready to use. Then, make the filling: Peel, core, and dice the apples. Place them in a large bowl and stir in the lemon juice. Stir in the sugar, cinnamon and flour until combined. Let the mixture sit 5 minutes then pour it into the prepared pie crust. Sprinkle the crumb topping over the filling and bake for 35-40 minutes or until the top is browned.

Beat in each egg, one at a time until well blended, adding vanilla at the end. In a separate bowl, mix together flour and baking powder. Alternate adding the flour mixture and the milk into the butter mixture. Blend together until everything is incorporated. Pour batter evenly into the 2 cake pans. Bake for 30-40 minutes (depending on your oven) until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.Remove from oven and allow to cool. Meanwhile, prepare icing: With an electric mixer, cream butter, Crisco and salt until smooth (about 5 minutes.) Add vanilla and almond extracts, if desired. Blend in powdered sugar, adding as much water or milk as you need to get the consistency you want. ** **Note: This prepares enough icing for a thin layer over the top and sides of both cakes. If you prefer a lot of icing on your cake, you might want to double the recipe. To assemble: Place bottom layer of cake on your serving plate and using a large bread knife, cut off the top of the cake so that it becomes flat (this will help the pudding stay put!) Using a cake decorating bag (or a Ziploc bag with a corner cut off), pipe a ring of frosting around the edge of the bottom cake layer. This will act as a barrier to keep the pudding from leaking out the sides of the cake. Fill the inside of the frosting barrier with the prepared pudding (use as much or as little as you would like.) Put the top layer on the cake and cover with icing, decorating with the remaining icing however your heart desires! I hope you enjoy!",

If it does not, discard and use a fresh package of yeast. Stir in the egg, oil and remaining milk. Put the flour and remaining sugar in the work bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade. Process 2 seconds. With the machine running, pour the warm milk mixture down the feed tube in a steady stream. Process until it forms a rough ball. If ball is sticky and wet, add a little more flour. Process a few seconds longer, or until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Remove dough to a lightly floured board. Knead dough, dusting with flour to keep it from sticking, until smooth and elastic, about 2 minutes. Place in a large oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm spot until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down dough and place on a lightly floured surface. It is now ready to form into rolls, buns or loaves. If preparing filled buns: Cut dough in half. Form each half into a 12-inch long log; cut into 10 pieces. Roll each piece into a 4-inch circle. Roll outer inch of each circle 1/8-inch thin; leave middle slightly thicker. If right-handed, place a dough circle in palm of your left hand. Put a big tablespoon of filling in the; middle; put left thumb over the filling. With your right hand, bring up edge and make a pleat in it. Rotate circle a little and make a second pleat. As you make each pleat, gently pull it up and around as if to enclose your thumb. Continue rotating, pleating and pinching, then gently twist into a spiral. Pinch to seal. Place bun pleated side down on a parchment square. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Put buns 1 1/2 inches apart on a baking sheet. Let rise until doubled in size, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Beat egg yolks with water and sugar; brush over buns. Bake 20 minutes.",

In a deep bowl cream 6 tablespoons of the butter with 3/4 cup sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the 2 eggs, one at a time, then beat in the 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Add the flour mixture alternately with the 1/2 cup of the milk in 3 additions, Beating the batter smooth after each addition. Divide the batter between the 2 prepared pans. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 15 minutes or until cakes begin to shrink away from the sides of the pans and centers spring back when lightly touched.

Immediately add 1/4 cup of the sugar and the salt, stirring until dissolved. Remove the pan from the heat. In a small bowl, combine 1/4 cup of the milk with the cornstarch and whisk to remove lumps. Whisk in the 2 eggs. Add the hot cream mixture in a thin stream, whisking constantly. Return to the mixture to the saucepan, bring to a boil, and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the custard thickens and is smooth (about 5 minutes).

Remove from the heat, cover and let stand at room temperature for 1 hour. Discard the vanilla bean. In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the cornstarch and the remaining 1 cup of sugar. Whisk in 1 cup of the milk mixture. Whisk the egg mixture into the milk in the saucepan and cook over moderately high heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula, until the custard just begins to thicken, about 4 minutes.

Simmer the shrimp until slightly firm and cooked through. This should only take 3-4 minutes once it comes to a simmer. Once cooked, drain off the water and set the shrimp in a mixing bowl. In another bowl, make the sauce. Add the lime juice, shallot, Thai chilies, palm sugar, and fish sauce. Mix well until the sugar gets dissolved. Once dissolved, taste, and adjust any seasoning if you prefer. You might want a bit more fish sauce, sugar, or lime. The goal is a sweet, sour and spicy combination. Once you have achieved this, add the mint, cilantro, and toasted rice powder. Give this a good stir. Add the shrimp into the sauce, toss to coat, and get ready to plate. Onto two serving plates, add some peanuts and half of the cabbage and green beans. Add some rice to each plate then add the shrimp larb to the other side. Put a bit of rice and shrimp into a green cabbage leaf and top with some green beans and peanuts. The end result is nothing short of amazing. It packs the perfect punch in flavor, texture, spice and overall balance. Plus it is super fresh and healthy to boot. This is a perfect dish for any party or any day of the week. Hope you enjoy!",

Authors Note: Purchase brands like [best] Tabasco Chili Starter, Caroll & Shelbys Or Wick Foweler's Chili Starter Kits. You can add the Masa packets included in most brand boxed kits to thicken your chili but I personally wouldn't. It tends to leave a dusty aftertaste. Before cooking, decide if you'd enjoy any one of the other items listed in the additional meats, spices or fresh ingredients sections and add them to your pot as well. Authors Note: If you choose to add meat, fry the meat and drain it first before adding it to your chili. Fry and add meat at the beginning of your boil. Authors Note: If you do decide on adding several other ingredients to your chili, you'll DEFINITELY need to add additional chili powder to taste. Start with 1 tablespoon to your simmer, mix, taste, then add additional chili powder 1 teaspoon at a time until you've reached an acceptable level.

Water will become brown from the onions. To your water and onions in the large sausepan, add the rice, lentils, cumin, salt and pepper. (I have made this dish with and without the cumin. It tastes very good either way. Experiment to find your preferred version.)

Place potatoes and apples in the crock pot. Heat oil in a 12-inch stainless steel pan over medium heat. Place pork in the pan and cover with a splatter screen (makes a bit of a mess without one). Saute until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side (you might start checking the second side after 3 minutes for browning). Place pork into crock pot over apples. Add onion to saute pan, stir well, and cook about 2 minutes. Deglaze with chicken broth, add pepper and thyme, and stir to scrape up brown bits off of pan. Transfer to crock pot. If using cabbage, add it on top at this time as well. Let pan soak for ease of cleaning. Cook in crock pot for 1 1/2 hours on high, then 4 1/2 hours on low.

Scrape down the sides of the bowl if necessary, then puree for a good minute or two until you have a smooth, creamy mixture. Set aside. For the crostini: Place baguette slices on a large baking sheet in a single layer. Drizzle with olive oil and bake at 375 degrees F for 5-7 minutes until bread is toasty and lightly browned. Set aside. For the peas: Toss all ingredients together in a medium bowl. You can do this ahead of time and keep the pea mixture in the fridge until youre ready to use it (this will also let the flavors meld a bit!) To assemble: Spread whipped feta on toasted baguette slices (I use about one teaspoon per crostini). I like to use a spoon to spread the cheese around, and then make a dent in the cheese on the center of the crostini so that the peas have a little nest to sit in (and dont roll all over the place). Top each crostini with a spoonful of the pea mixture, arrange on a plate, and serve immediately. Notes: This was super garlicky (in an awesome, awesome way), but if youre not big on garlic, cut it down to one clove or omit the garlic altogether. Dress up these crostini however you like add a drizzle of good olive oil, honey, or balsamic reduction, toss some diced red onions in with the pea mixture, finish them off with some lemon zest, or swap the mint for basil to give it a different twist. This feta would also be great with some herbs mixed in. throw in basil, thyme, or whatever you have on hand! You could also toast the bread on the grill if you like!",

        "Additional supplies needed: a sheet of cheese cloth and a KitchenAid stand mixer with whisk attachment. I used a KitchenAid, however rumor has it that you can shake the crap out of the cream in a large mason jar. I support KitchenAid, so I went that route. Start by adding the heavy cream into the KitchenAid bowl. Beat it on medium to medium-high spin for about 10 minutes, keeping an eye on it along the way. After about 10 minutes, possibly sooner, the cream begins to curdle and separate. Its cool, its really cool. Once it separates, turn off the mixer. Drain off the liquid. You can reserve the liquid should you desire. Once the liquid has been drained, return the solids back to the mixer. Add in the ice cold water, and continue to mix until you have a tight, solid mixture. Drain the excess water. Once you think the liquid has been drained, it has not. Use a large wooden spoon and press the butter against the bowl. Lots of liquid will come out, trust me. Continue until you know that all of the liquid has been removed. I ensured this by placing the butter into some cheese cloth and tightening it until all of the liquid was removed. Now you can add salt if you desire. Do that at this time, if using. You could add Sriracha salt as well. Give a gentle stir then put it into a sealed tight container. Store in the refrigerator. Yep, thats how butter is made. Way too simple. The end result is a great, really great butter. I havent seen my wife spread butter on a bagel in some time, and she was all over that. We spread it on corn, as well as seared up some ham sandwiches. Give this a shot if you want some really good product, and remember, use organic ingredients. I think that makes a huge difference.",

        "For the infused liquors: peel the cucumbers and mangos. Slice cucumbers in quarters lengthwise, and score a crosshatch pattern in the mangos. Let each sit in its respective 750 ml liquors (rum for mangos, tequila for cukes) 24 hours at room temperature in an air tight container. Use a cheese cloth to strain the liquors back into their original bottles, or any other you prefer. If you are brave enough to eat the resulting leftover mango you are in for a very boozy treat! In a shaker, muddle strawberry, mint leaves, and lime juice. Add agave nectar, rum, tequila, and ice to shaker and shake. Strain into ice filled pint glass and garnish with strawberry and mint.
